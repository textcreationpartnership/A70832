            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <byline>Translated from the GREEK by <hi>Robert Midgley,</hi> M.D. &amp; Col. Med. Lond. Cand.</byline>
               <p>THere is an old Story, Friend <hi>Terentius Priscus,</hi> as if heretofore Eagles or Swans flying from the opposite Bounds of the Earth, met together where now stands the Temple of <hi>Apollo Pythius,</hi> in the Place now called <hi>The Navel:</hi> And that somewhile after, <hi>Epimenides</hi> the <hi>Phaestian</hi> willing to satisfie his Curiosity, enquired of the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which was the <hi>Navel</hi> or <hi>Middle</hi> of the World; but receiv'd such an Answer as made him never a Jot the wiser:
<q>
                     <l>The Centre of the Earth is justly known</l>
                     <l>(Conceal'd from Mortals) to the Gods alone.</l>
                  </q> Thus fitly did the <hi>God</hi> chastise this bold Inquirer into Ancient Traditions.</p>
               <p>But in our Time, not long before the Celebration of the <hi>Pythian</hi> Games, during the <hi>Magistracy</hi> of <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus,</hi> there were Two famous Men, who coming as it were from the Two opposite Ends of the World, met together at the City of <hi>Delphos.</hi> The One was <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Grammarian,</hi> who came from <hi>England,</hi> to return to <hi>Tarsus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where he was born: The Other, <hi>Cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mbrotus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who had been long
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46327:5"/> conversant in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and made several Voyages, as well on the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> as other Parts; not as a Merchant, to get Money, but to improve his Knowledg, and enrich his Mind; for he had enough to live upon, and car'd for no more. He having been lately at the Temple and <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> seem'd not much to marvel at any Thing he there saw: Yet he mentioned to us one Particular (which he said was told him by the <hi>Priests</hi> of the Temple) touching she Lamp that is never extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd, and spendeth every Year less than the former: Whence he conjectured an Inequality of Years, and that the <hi>latter</hi> was still shorter than the <hi>preceding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Discourse was much wondred at by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> amongst the rest, affirm'd it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, to ground the Knowledg of such great Matters, on such slight and trivial Conjectures: For, this was not (as <hi>Alcaeus</hi> said) to paint the Lyon from the Measure of his Claw, but to change and disorder the Motions of Celestial Bodies, for the sake of a Lamp, or the Snuff of a Candle, and to overthrow at one Stroak all the <hi>Mathematical</hi> Sciences. These Men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> will not be mov'd by what you say; for first, they will not yield to <hi>Mathematicians</hi> in point of Certainty, seeing they may be easilier mistaken in their Comprehension of Time, it being so slippery and fallacious and at such a Distance from them, than these Men in the Measures of their Oyl, about which they are so exact and careful. Moreover, <hi>Demetrius</hi> by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that small Things are oft the Signs and Indications of great, must prejudice several Arts and Sciences, and deprive them of the Proofs of several Conclusions and Predictions. And yet you <hi>Grammarians</hi> will needs vouch, That the <hi>Demi-Gods</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> which were at the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, shav'd with Razors, because you find in <hi>Homer</hi> the mention of such an Instrument; That, also, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And because that in several other Places the same Poet calls the Night quick and sharp, you'll needs have him to mean by this Word, That the shadow of the Earth being round, groweth sharp at the End like the Body of a Pyramid. Again, who is he that denying small Things to be the Signs and Proofs of great, will allow what <hi>Physicians</hi> tell us, namely, That great Numbers of Spiders foretel a Pestilent Summer, and also that in the Spring, when the Olive-Tree Leaves are as large as a Crows Foot, it is then a good Time to put out to Sea? And, who will measure the Greatness of the Suns Body, by <hi>Clepsydres,</hi> or Water-Dyals, with a Pint or Quart of Water? Or prove, that a small Table like a Tyle, making a sharp Angle, leaning on a Plain <hi>Superficies,</hi> should shew the just Measure of the Elevation of the <hi>Pole</hi> from the <hi>Horizon,</hi> which is ever to be seen in our <hi>Hemisphere?</hi> And this is what the <hi>Priests</hi> may alledge, in favor of what they affirm; so that we must offer other Arguments against them, if we will maintain the Course of the Sun to be fixt and unchangeable, as we here hold it to be. Not only of the Sun (cry'd out aloud the Philosopher <hi>Ammonius,</hi> who was there present) but also of the whole Heaven; for the Passage which he makes from one <hi>Tropique</hi> to another, must of necessity be shortned, seeing he takes not up so great a Part of the <hi>Horizon</hi> as the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> do imagain, but becomes less and shorter, as the Southern Part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the Northern. Whence consequently, the Summer will fall out to be Shorter, and the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Air Colder, by reason of the Sun's turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more inwardly, and shewing greater Parallels, and equal distant Circles in the Points of its Reversions, than are in the longest Day in Summer, and the shortest
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46327:6"/> in Winter. It would moreover also follow, That the Pins of the Dials in the City of <hi>Syene</hi> will be more shadowless at the Summer <hi>Tropique</hi> or <hi>Solstice,</hi> and not a few of the Fixed Stars run under or against one and ther for want of Room. And should it be alledged, That all the other Celestial Bodies keep their Courses and ordinary Motions, without any Change, they will never be able to cite any Cause which shall hasten his Motion alone above all the rest; but will be forced to confound and disorder all evident Appearances which do clearly shew themselves to our Eyes, and especially those of the Moon: So that there will be no need of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving these Measures of Oyl to know the Difference of the Years, because the Eclipses will do this, if there be any, seeing the Sun does oft meet with the Moon, and the Moon as oft falls within the Shadow of the Earth; so that we need not any longer hold arguing on this Matter. Well, but (say's <hi>Cleombrotus</hi>) I my self have seen the Measure of the Oyl, for they have shewed it several Years; but that of the Present, is far less than that of Ancient Times. Unto which <hi>Ammonius</hi> answered, How comes it to pass then that other People who have the Inextinguishible Fire in Veneration, and have preserved it even Time out of Mind, could never remark this? And granting what you say concerning this Measure of Oyl, is it not better to attribute the Cause of this to some Coldness or Dampness of Air; Or, on the contrary, to some Heat or Dryness, by which the Fire in the Lamp being weakned, needs not so much Nourishment, neither could consume the same Quantity? For, 'tis well known, that Fire burns better in Winter than in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, its Heat being drawn in, and enclosed by the Cold, whereas in great Heats and dry Weather 'tis weakned, lying dead and languishing without any Strength; and if it be kindled in Sunny Weather, its
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46327:6"/> Efficacy is small, hardly catching hold of the Wood, and slowly consuming the Fuel. But we may with greater Probability attribute the Circumstance of the Oyl, to the Oyl it self; for Oyl formerly was of less Nutriment, as squeezed out of Olives which grew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Young Trees; but being since better order'd, as coming of Plants more fully grown, must needs be more effectual to the nourishing and keeping of the Fire. And this is the best way of saving the Credit of the <hi>Ammonian</hi> Priests in their Supposition, which will not endure the Test of Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ammonius</hi> having finished his Discourse, I pray said I, <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> give us some Account of the <hi>Oracle,</hi> for it has been ever in great Esteem in those Parts, till these Times wherein its Divinity and Reputation seems to be decayed. Unto which <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> making no Answer, but looking down on the Ground, <hi>Demetrius</hi> took up the Discourse saying, You need not busie your self in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after the <hi>Oracles</hi> in those Parts, seeing we find the <hi>Oracles</hi> in these to fail, or to speak better, to be totally silenced, except Two or Three; so that 'twould be more to the Purpose to search into the Cause of this Silence. But we are more concern'd in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> which although formerly famous throughout all the World for <hi>Oracles,</hi> is now like a Fountain dried up, so that at present we find them dumb. For at this Day there's no Place in all <hi>Boeotia,</hi> unless in the Town of <hi>Lebadia,</hi> where one can draw out any Divination, all other Parts being become silent and forsaken. Yet in the Time of the War against the <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Ptous Apollo</hi> was in Request, as also that of <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> for both of 'em were tryed; that of <hi>Ptous Apollo,</hi> when the <hi>Priest</hi> who was always wont to return the <hi>Oracles</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers in <hi>Greek,</hi> spake to him that was sent from the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in their own Barbarous Language, so that none of the Assistants understood a Word, whereby
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46327:7"/> they were given to understand, That 'twas not lawfull for the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to have the Use of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue at their Pleasure. And as to that of <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> the Person that was sent thither, having fall'n asleep in the Sanctuary, he dream'd he heard the Minister of that <hi>God</hi> bidding him be gon out of the Temple, and saying <hi>That his</hi> God <hi>was not there,</hi> and presently shoved him out thence with both his Hands; and seeing he still stopt by the Way, he took up a great Stone, and struck him with it on the Head. And what was this, but a Prediction and Denunciation of what was to come to pass? For <hi>Mardonius</hi> was not long after defeated by <hi>Pausanias,</hi> who was no King, but only the King of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi>'s Guardian, and the then Lievetenant of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army, and was with a Stone flung out of a Sling, fell'd to the Ground, just as the <hi>Lydian</hi> Servant thought he was struck in his Dream. In the same Manner also flourished the <hi>Oracle</hi> near <hi>Tegyra,</hi> where 'tis said <hi>Apollo</hi> himself was born, and in Effect, there are Two Rivers that slide near one another, one of which is called the <hi>Palm-Tree</hi> and the other the <hi>Olive-Tree.</hi> And at this <hi>Oracle</hi> in the Time of the <hi>Medes</hi> War, <hi>Echerates</hi> being then the Prophet, the God <hi>Apollo</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by his Mouth, That <hi>the Honor and Profit of this War would fall to the</hi> Greeks <hi>Share.</hi> And during the <hi>Peloponesian</hi> War, the <hi>Delians</hi> having been driven out of their <hi>Island,</hi> they had Word brought them from the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> that they should search for the Place where <hi>Apollo</hi> was born, and there make some certain Sacrifices. At which they marvelling, and demanding, Whether <hi>Apollo</hi> was born elsewhere than in their Parts, the Prophetess <hi>Pythia</hi> moreover told them, That <hi>a Crow would shew them the Place.</hi> These Deputies from the <hi>Delians,</hi> in their Return Home past by Chance through the City of <hi>Chaeronea,</hi> where they heard their Hostess talking to some Travellers about the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Tegyra,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:46327:7"/> to whom they were going, and at their parting they heard 'em say to her, <hi>Adieu Dame</hi> Coron; by which they comprehended the meaning of <hi>Pythia</hi>'s Answer; and having offered their Sacrifices at <hi>Tegyra,</hi> they were soon after restored and established in their own Country. Yet there have been given later An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers from these <hi>Oracles,</hi> than those you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but now they have wholly ceas'd, so that 'twill not be besides the Matter, seeing we are at <hi>Apollo Pythius,</hi> to enquire after the Cause of this Change.</p>
               <p>Thus discoursing together, we left the Temple, and were come as far as the <hi>Gnidian</hi> Hall, where entring in, we found our Friends which we lookt for, being sat down in Expectation of our coming. All the rest were at leasure, by reason of the time of the day, and did nothing but anoint their Bodies, or gaze on the Wrestlers, who were exercising of themselves. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Demetrius</hi> laughing, said to 'em, It seems to me, that you are not discoursing of any Matter of great Consequence, for I see, you labor not under deep Thoughts, 'Tis true, reply'd <hi>Heracleon</hi> the <hi>Megarian,</hi> we are not a-disputing, Whether the <hi>Verb</hi>

                  </gap>; for such Questions as these, make People knit their Brows. A Man may discourse of all other Matters, especially of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> without these frowning angry Looks that put the by-standers into a fright. Receive us then, said <hi>Demetrius,</hi> into your Company, and, if you please, the Question too which has been now agitated amongst us, which does well agree with the Place where we are, and, relating to the God <hi>Apollo,</hi> concerns therefore all that are here; but however, let's have no knitting of the Brows or frowning Looks. Being then all sat down
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46327:8"/> close together, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> having proposed the Question we were upon, <hi>Didymus</hi> the <hi>Cynic</hi> Philosopher, surnamed <hi>Planetiades,</hi> getting up on his Feet, and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Ground Two or Three Times with his Stick, cryed out, O <hi>Jupiter!</hi> what a hard Question do you offer, what a difficult Matter do you propose? for is it any wonder, the whole World wallowing in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Men having put away all Shame and Sence of Honor from them (as <hi>Hesiod</hi> long ago complain'd) that the <hi>Gods</hi> should no longer suffer their <hi>Oracles</hi> to be among them as heretofore? For my Part, I wonder there's so much as One left, and that <hi>Hercules</hi> or some other of the <hi>Gods,</hi> has not long since pluckt up, and carry'd away the <hi>Three-Footed-Stool,</hi> whereon is offered such base and villainous Questions to <hi>Apollo;</hi> some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him as a mere paltry <hi>Astrologer,</hi> to try his Skill, and impose on him by subtle Questions; others asking him about Treasures buried under-Ground, others about marrying a Fortune: So that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> will be here soon convinced of his Mistake, when he affirm'd, <hi>That the Time when Men are honestest, is when they present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before the</hi> Gods; for those filthy Passions which they dare not discover before a grave Mortal Man, they scruple not to utter to <hi>Apollo.</hi> He had gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if <hi>Heracleon</hi> had not pull'd him by the Sleeve; and my self, who was better acquainted than any in the Company besides, thus spake to him; Cease, Friend <hi>Planetiades,</hi> from angring <hi>Apollo</hi> against thee, seeing he is sharp and choleric, and not easily reconciled; for as <hi>Pindar</hi> says,
<q>That Men be favor Heav'n has him enjoyn'd.</q> And whether he be the Sun, or the Master of the Sun, or Father of it, being above all visible Natures, 'tis not to be suppos'd he disdains to hold any further enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with Men at this Time, seeing he gives them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46327:8"/> their Birth, Nourishment, Subsistence and Reason. Neither is it credible that the Divine Providence (who like a kind and indulgent Mother, produces and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves all Things for our Use) should shew her self malevolent only in the Matter of Divination, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of it having once given it us; as if, when there were more <hi>Oracles</hi> than there are now in the World, Men were not then as wicked. But let us make a <hi>Pythic</hi> Truce (as they say) with Vice, which you are always sharply reprehending, and sit down here with us to try, Whether we can find out any other Cause of the ceasing of <hi>Oracles;</hi> and let me only advise you by the way, to have better Thoughts of <hi>God,</hi> than to suppose him so prone to Anger. <hi>Planetiades</hi> was so moved with these Speeches, that he went away imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately without speaking a Word. The Company re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining a while in Silence, <hi>Ammonius</hi> addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to me, said, Prethee, <hi>Lamprias,</hi> let's take Care of what we say, and not be rash in our Assertions; for we do not well when we make <hi>God</hi> to be little or no Cause of these <hi>Oracles</hi> ceasing; for, he that attributes the failing of them to any other Cause than the Will and Decree of <hi>God,</hi> gives occasion to suspect his Belief, Whether there ever were, or are now any by his Disposition, but by some other Means; for there is no other more excellent and noble Cause and Power, which can destroy and abolish Divination, if it be the Work of <hi>God.</hi> And as for <hi>Planettades</hi> his Discourse, it does not at all please me, as well for the Inequality and Inconstancy which he attributes to <hi>God,</hi> as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasons. For he makes him sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting and detesting of Vice, and sometimes admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and receiving it, just as a King or rather a Tyrant, who drives wicked People out of one Gate, and receives them through another, and negotiates with them.

                  </gap> the greatest and most perfect
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46327:9"/> Work that will admit of no Additions, is that which agrees best with the Dignity of the <hi>Gods;</hi> by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing this, we may in my judgment affirm, That in this common Scarcity of Men occasioned by the former Wars and Seditions over all the World, <hi>Greece</hi> has most suffered; so that she can with much Difficulty raise 3000 Men, which Number the single City of <hi>Megara</hi> sent heretofore to the Battle of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taea.</hi> Wherefore if <hi>God</hi> now sorsakes several <hi>Oracles</hi> which anciently were frequented, what is this but a Sign that <hi>Greece</hi> is at this Time very much dispeopled, in Comparison of what it was heretofore; and he that will affirm this, shall not want for Arguments. For, of what Use would the <hi>Oracle</hi> be now, which was heretofore at <hi>Tegyar</hi> or at <hi>Pious?</hi> for scarcely shall you meet in a whole Days time, with so much as a Herdsman or Shepherd in those Parts. We find also in Writing, that this Place of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation where we now are, and which is as ancient as any, and as famous and renowned as any is in all <hi>Greece,</hi> was for a considerable Time deserted and inaccessible, by Means of a dangerous Creature that resorted thither, namely a <hi>Dragon.</hi> Yet those that have written this, did not well comprehend the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the <hi>Oracles</hi> ceasing; for, the <hi>Dragon</hi> did not make the Place solitary, but rather the Solitude of the Place occasioned the <hi>Dragon</hi> to repair thither. Since that Time, when <hi>Greece</hi> became populous and full of Towns, they had Two Women <hi>Prophetesses,</hi> who went down one after another into the <hi>Hole.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there was a Third chosen, if need were; whereas now there is but one, and yet we do not complain of it, because she's sufficient. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do not well to repine at Providence, seeing there's no want of Divinations, where all that come are satisfied in whatever they desire to know. <hi>Homer</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:46327:9"/> tells us, <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had Nine <hi>Heralds,</hi> and yet with these could he hardly keep in Order the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they being so many in Number; but you'll find now, that the Voice of one Man is sufficient to be heard all over the <hi>Theatre.</hi> The <hi>Oracles</hi> then spake by more Organs or Voices, because there were then a greater Number of Men. So that we should think it strange, if <hi>God</hi> should suffer to be spilt and run to waste like Water, the Prophetical Divination, every where resounding, as in the Fields we hear the Rocks in Mountains echoing the Voices of bleating Cattel. <hi>Ammonius</hi> having said these Words, and I returning no Answer, <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> took up the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and addressing himself to me; Hast thou then, said he, confess'd that 'tis <hi>God</hi> who makes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes <hi>Oracles?</hi> Not I, said I; for I maintain, That <hi>God</hi> was never the Cause of taking away and abolishing any <hi>Oracle</hi> or Divination; but, on the contrary, whereas he produces and prepares several Things for our Use, so Nature leads them into Corruption, and not seldom into a Privation of their whole Being. Or, to speak better, Matter, which is it self Privation, often flies away, and dissolves what a more excellent <hi>Being</hi> than her self had wrought. So that I am of Opinion, there are other Causes which obscure and extinguish these Prophetic Spirits: For, tho <hi>God</hi> does give to Men several good and excellent Things, yet he gives to none of 'em the Power to exist eternally; for tho they never dye, yet their Gifts do (as <hi>Sophocles</hi> speaks.) 'Twere then well becoming <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who exercise themselves in the Study of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>First Matter,</hi> to enquire into the Existence, Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Tendency of those Things, but to leave the Origin and First Cause to <hi>God,</hi> as is most reasonable. For 'tis a very childish and silly Thing to suppose, That <hi>God</hi> himself does, like the <hi>Spirits</hi> speaking in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46327:10"/> Bowels of possessed Persons, (which were anciently called <hi>Eurycles,</hi> and now <hi>Pythons</hi>) enter into the Bodies of the Prophets, and speak by their Mouths and Voices, as fit Instruments for that Purpose; for he that thus mixes <hi>God</hi> in Human Affairs, has not that Respect and Reverence which is due to so great a Majesty, as being ignorant of his Power and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> then answered, You say very well, but 'tis a hard Matter to comprehend and define, how far this Providence does extend it self. They seem both alike faulty to me, who will have <hi>God</hi> to be the Cause of Nothing in the World, and those who will have him to be concerned in all Things; for both of these are run into Extremes. But as those say well, who hold that <hi>Plato,</hi> having invented this Element, on which spring up the <hi>Qualities</hi> which we sometimes call the <hi>First Matter,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Nature,</hi> has thereby delivered the <hi>Philosophers</hi> from several great Difficulties: so it seems to me, that those who have rankt the <hi>Genus</hi> of <hi>Daemons</hi> between that of <hi>Gods</hi> and Men, have solved greater Doubts and Difficulties, as having found the Knot which does, as it were, joyn and hold together our Society and Communication with them. 'Tis uncertain whence this Opinion arose, whether from the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Magi</hi> and <hi>Zoroastres,</hi> or from <hi>Thrace</hi> by <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or from <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Phrygia,</hi> as may be conjectured from the Sight of the Sacrifices, which are made in both Countries, where amongst their Holy and Divine Ceremonies, there's seen a Mixture of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Mourning. And, as to the <hi>Greeks, Homer</hi> has indifferently used these Two Names, terming sometimes the <hi>Gods, Daemons,</hi> and other whiles <hi>Daemons, Gods.</hi> But <hi>Hesiod</hi> was the first that did best and most distinctly lay down Four Reasonable Natures, the <hi>Gods,</hi> the <hi>Daemons</hi> (being many in Number, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46327:10"/> good in their Kind) the <hi>Demy-Gods,</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> for, <hi>Hero's</hi> are reckoned amongst the <hi>Demy-Gods.</hi> Others say, there's a Transmutation of Bodies, as well as of Souls, just as we see, of the Earth is engendred Water, of the Water the Air, and of the Air Fire, the Nature of the Substance still ascending higher; so, good <hi>Spirits</hi> always change for the best, being transformed from <hi>Men</hi> into <hi>Demy-Gods,</hi> and from <hi>Demy-Gods</hi> into <hi>Daemons,</hi> and from <hi>Daemons</hi> by Degrees and in a long Space of Time, being refined and purified, they come to partake of the Nature of the <hi>Divinity.</hi> But there are some that cannot contain themselves, but rove about till they be entangled into Mortal Bodies, where they live meanly and obscurely like Smoak. And moreover, <hi>Hesiod</hi> imagins, that the <hi>Daemons</hi> themselves after certain Revolutions of Time, do at Length dye; for introducing a <hi>Nymph</hi> speaking, he marks the Time wherein they expire:
<q>
                     <l>Nine times Man's Age at's prime, it plain appears:</l>

And it seems also, that <hi>Hesiod</hi> by these Words intimated the Consummation of the World by Fire; at which Time 'tis likely the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> with the Rivers, Marshes, and Woods where they inhabit, shall be consumed:
<q>
                     <l>Such as in Woods, or Grotto's Shady Cell,</l>

                  </q> I have heard, says <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> this alledged by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and find that the <hi>Stoical Conflagration</hi> hath not only intruded it self upon the Works of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> but also <hi>Hesiod's,</hi> by imposing such Meanings on their Words as they never thought on. Neither can I any more approve of this Consummation of the World, which they maintain; neither is it possible to have made just Observations on the Lives of Animals, as appears by the Number of Years which they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46327:11"/> to Crows and Stags. Moreover, the Year con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it self the Beginning and End of all Things which the Seasons bring and the Earth produces, may, in my Opinion, be not impertinently called <hi>The Age of Man;</hi> for your selves confess, that <hi>Hesiod</hi> does some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where call the Life of Man <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; What say you, does he not? Which <hi>Demetrius</hi> confessing, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Manner: 'Tis also certain, that we call the Vessels whereby we measure Things, by the Names of the Things measured in them. As we then call an Unite a Number, though it be but the least Part and Measure, and the Beginning of a Number; so has he called a Year the Age of Man, because 'tis the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure wherewith 'tis measured. As for those Numbers which those others describe, they be not of such Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and Importance. But the Sum of 9720, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of Four special Numbers orderly arising from One; and the same added together, and multiplyed by Four every way, amounts to Forty: these Forties being reduced into Triangles by Five Times, make up the Total of the forecited Number. But as to that, 'tis not necessary to enter into a Debate with <hi>Demetrius;</hi> for, whether it be a short or a long Time, certain or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, wherewith <hi>Hesiod</hi> limits the Soul of a <hi>Daemon,</hi> and the Life of a <hi>Demy-God,</hi> either of those will prove, by ancient and evident Testimonies, that there are Natures neuter and mean, and as it were in the Confines of the <hi>Gods</hi> and Men, subject to Mortal Passions, and to receive Mutations and necessary Changes; which Natures, according to the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Example of our Predecessors, 'tis sitting we should call <hi>Daemons,</hi> and give them all due Honor. To which Purpose <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> one of the familiar Friends of <hi>Plato,</hi> was wont to alledge the Example of Triangles, which agree very well with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for, that Triangle which has Three Sides, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46327:12"/> equal Angles, he compared unto the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi> Nature, and that which has all Three un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, to the <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Mortal</hi> Nature, and that which has Two equal and One unequal, to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Daemons,</hi> which is endued with the Passions and Perturbations of the <hi>Mortal</hi> Nature, and the Force and Power of the Divine. Even Nature has set before us sensible Figures and Resemblances of this; of the <hi>Gods,</hi> the Sun and the Stars; of Mortal Men, the Comets, Flashings in the Night, and shooting Stars; And this Similitude is taken up by <hi>Euripides,</hi> when he saith,
<q>
                     <l>He that but now was fleshy, plump and gay,</l>
                     <l>As a faln Star his Glories melt away;</l>
                     <l>Like that extinguisht on the Ground he lies</l>
                     <l>Breathing his Soul into the ambient Skies,</l>
                     <l>Which strait embodyed in its Vehicle</l>
                     <l>Does in the Air like other <hi>Daemons</hi> dwell:</l>
                  </q> And for a mixt Body representing the Nature of <hi>Daemons,</hi> the Moon; which some observing to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to encrease and decrease, and wholly to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, have thought it very agreeable to the mutable Condition of <hi>Daemons;</hi> and have for this Reason ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her a Terrestrial Star, others <hi>Olympic</hi> Earth, and others the Inheritance and Possession of <hi>Proserpine</hi> both Heavenly and Earthly. As one then that should take from the World the Air, and remove it from between the Moon and the Earth, would dissolve the Continuation and Composition of the Universe, by leaving an empty Place in the Midst, without any Contexture to hold the Two Parts together; so those that do not allow <hi>Daemons,</hi> do oppose all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and Conference of the <hi>Gods</hi> with Men, seeing they destroy that Nature (as <hi>Plato</hi> says) which serves as an Interpreter and Messenger between 'em both; or else they constrain us to perplex and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46327:12"/> all Things together, by mixing the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature with <hi>Human</hi> Passions, and plucking it down from Heaven, as the Women of <hi>Thessaly</hi> are said to do the Moon; which Fiction has met with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in some Women; because <hi>Aglaonice,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Agetor</hi> being skilful in <hi>Astrology,</hi> made the Vulgar believe, that by Means of some Charms and Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, she could bring the Moon down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But as to us, let's not think there are any <hi>Oracles</hi> or <hi>Divinations</hi> without some <hi>Divinity,</hi> or that the <hi>Gods</hi> are not pleas'd with Sacrifices, and our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and other Ceremonies. And, on the other Hand, let's not think that <hi>God</hi> is present in them, or employs himself personally about them, but that he does commit them to his Officers the <hi>Daemons,</hi> who are the Spies and Scouts of the <hi>Gods,</hi> wandring and circuiting about at their Commands; some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and ordering the sacred Ceremonies and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations offered to the <hi>Gods,</hi> others being employ'd to revenge and punish the high Misdemeanors and enormous Injustices of Men. There are moreover others, to whom <hi>Hesiod</hi> gives a very venerable Name, calling them, the Distributers of Riches, and Donor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Largesses among Mortals; for the <hi>Gods</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them the Privilege, and granted them a Royal Commission to see them duly distributed. As informing here by the Way, that to be benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and liberal of Favors, is the proper Office of a King. For there is a Difference of Virtue between these <hi>Daemons,</hi> as much as between Men, and there are some of them in whom still there are some small Remains (tho weak and scarcely discernible) of the Sensitive and Irrational Soul, which like a small Quantity of Excrements and Superfluities, stay still behind. Others there are, in whom there abideth a greater Measure of these gross Humors, the Marks
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46327:13"/> and Traces of which, are to be seen in many Places, by the odd and singular Ceremonies and Sacrifices which they require, as is vulgarly known. As to the Mysteries and secret Ceremonies, by which we may more clearly, than by any other Means, understand the Nature of <hi>Daemons;</hi> I shall, with <hi>Herodotus,</hi> be cautious in treating of that Matter. But as to the certain Feasts and direful Sacrifices, which are held as Unfortunate and Mournful Days, and are celebrated by eating raw Flesh, and which is torn with Men's Nails; or, other Days wherein they fast, and smite their Breasts; and, in several Places, where filthy and dishonest Words are uttered during the Sacrifices, I will never think this done on any of the <hi>God's</hi> Account, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to avert, mollify, and appease the Wrath and Fury of some <hi>bad Daemons:</hi> for, 'tis not likely there ever was a <hi>God</hi> that expected or required men to be sacrificed to him, as has been anciently done, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such kind of Sacrifices with Approbation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must we imagine 'twas for nothing, that Kings and Great Men have delivered their own Children to be sacrificed, or that they sacrificed them themselves with their own Hands; seeing, they intended hereby to avert and appease the Malice and Rancor of some <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> or to satisfy the violent and raging Lusts of some, who either could not or would not enjoy them with their Bodies or by their Bodies. Even as <hi>Hercules</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged the City of <hi>Oechalia,</hi> for a Wench that was therein: so these Powerful and Tyrannical <hi>Daemons,</hi> requiring some Human Soul, which is still compassed with a Body, and yet not being able to satisfie their Lust by the Body; do therefore bring the Plague and Famin into Towns, raise Wars and Seditions, till such Time as they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and enjoy that which they love. Others, on the contrary (as I remember I observ'd in <hi>Candia,</hi> for I was some considerable Time there) celebrate a Feast, in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46327:13"/> which they shew the Figure of a Man without a Head saying, 'Tis <hi>Molus,</hi> the Father of <hi>Meriones,</hi> who having violently laid Hands on a <hi>Nymph,</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards seen without a Head. The Rapes committed on Boys or Girls; the long Voyages, Flights, Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and voluntary Services of the <hi>Gods,</hi> which are sung by the <hi>Poets,</hi> and related by the Celebration of their Wit or Power, are not Passions and Virtues sitting to be attributed to <hi>Gods</hi> but to <hi>Daemons.</hi> Neither is <hi>Aeschylus</hi> in the right when he says,
<q>Divine <hi>Apollo</hi> banisht from the Sky.</q> Nor <hi>Admetus</hi> in <hi>Sophocles;</hi>
                  <q>My Cock by crowing led him to the Mill.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Delphos</hi> were far from the Truth when they asserted, That there was a Combat between <hi>Apollo</hi> and a <hi>Dragon</hi> about the Possession of this <hi>Oracle.</hi> No less are they to blame who suffer the <hi>Poets</hi> or <hi>Orators</hi> in the open <hi>Thearres</hi> to Act or Speak of such Matters; whereby they seem to condemn those Things which themselves perform in their sacred Solemnities. <hi>Philippus</hi> wondring at what was last said (for this Man was an Historian, and then present in the Company) he enquired what Divine Solemnities they contradicted and condemned, who contend one against another in the <hi>Theatres.</hi> Even those, quoth <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> which concern the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and by which this City having lately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and received into these Ceremonies and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, all the <hi>Greeks</hi> without <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> and excluded those that dwell as far as the Vale of <hi>Tempe.</hi> For, the <hi>Tabernacle of Boughs</hi> which is set up every Ninth Year, within the Court-Yard of this Temple, is not a Representation of the <hi>Dragons</hi> Den, but of some <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Tyrant;</hi> and the assaulting of it in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46327:14"/> great Silence, by the Way termed <hi>Delonia.</hi> And immediately they lead hither a young Youth whose Father and Mother is still living, with Torches burning; and having set this Tabernacle on Fire, and overthrown the Table, they run away as fast as they are able, through the Doors of the Temple, never looking behind them. In fine, this Boys Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, together with his Servile Offices, and expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Sacrifices about <hi>Tempe,</hi> seem to declare the Commission of some horrid Crime in this Place. For it looks silly to affirm, That <hi>Apollo</hi> for having kill'd the <hi>Dragon,</hi> was forc'd to fly to the farthest Parts of <hi>Greece</hi> to be cleansed and purified; and, that he there made certain Offerings and Libations, as Men do when they design the appeasing those vindictive Spirits, whom we call <hi>Alastoras</hi> and <hi>Palamnaeos,</hi> which is to say, the Revengers of such Crimes as cannot be forgotten, but must have Punishment. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Relation which I have heard touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Flight, is very strange and wonderful; but if there be any Truth in it, we must not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose 'twas an ordinary and common Matter, which happn'd then about this <hi>Oracle.</hi> Yet lest I should be thought, as <hi>Empedocles</hi> says,
<q>
                     <l>Starting new Heads, to wander from the Text,</l>
                     <l>And make the Theme we have in Hand, perplext,</l>
                  </q> I entreat you let me put a fit Conclusion to my Discourse (for now the Time requires it) and to say what several have said before me, That when the <hi>Daemons,</hi> who are appointed for the Government and Superintendency of <hi>Oracles,</hi> do fail, the <hi>Oracles</hi> must of Necessity also fail too; and, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part else-where, the Divining Powers, must likewise cease in those Places, but returning again after a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46327:14"/> long Time, the Places will begin again to speak; like Musical Instruments, if handled by those that know how to use them. <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> having said thus much, <hi>Heracleon</hi> took up the Discourse, saying; We have never an <hi>Infidel</hi> amongst us, but are all agreed in our Opinions touching the <hi>Gods.</hi> Yet let's have a Care, <hi>Philippus,</hi> lest in the Heat and Multiplicity of our Words, we unawares broach not some false Doctrine that may tend to Impiety. Well! but saith <hi>Philippus,</hi> I hope <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> has not said any thing which may occasion this Caution. His asserting (says <hi>Heracleon</hi>) That they be not the <hi>Gods</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side over the <hi>Oracles</hi> (because we are to suppose them free from all Worldly Care) but <hi>Daemons,</hi> or the <hi>Gods</hi> Officers or Messengers, does not scandalize me; but to assert from <hi>Empedocles,</hi> That these <hi>Daemons</hi> are the Causes of all the Calamities, Vexations and Plagues, which happen to Mortal Men, and in the End to make them to dye like them; this, in my Mind, savors of bold Presumption. <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> having askt <hi>Philippus,</hi> Who this Young Man was, and being inform'd of his Name and Country, he proceeded in this Manner: I know very well, <hi>Heracleon</hi> that the Discourse I used may bear an absurd Construction; but there's no speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great Matters, without laying first great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, for the Proof of ones Opinion. But as for your part, you are not sensible, how you contradict even that which you allow; for, granting as you do, that there be <hi>Daemons,</hi> but not allowing 'em to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and mortal, you cannot prove there are any at all; for, wherein do they differ from <hi>Gods,</hi> supposing they be incorruptible and impassible, and not liable to Error? Whilst <hi>Heracleon</hi> was musing and studying how to answer this, <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> went on, saying, 'Tis not only <hi>Empedocles</hi> who affirms there are <hi>bad Daemons,</hi> but even <hi>Plato, Xenocrates,</hi> and <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> yea and <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46327:15"/> when he prayed he might meet with <hi>good Spirits;</hi> which shews, That he thought there were <hi>bad,</hi> as well as <hi>good Daemons.</hi> And as to their Mortality, I have heard it reported from a Person that was neither Fool nor Knave, being <hi>Epitherses,</hi> the Father of <hi>Aemilianus</hi> the <hi>Orator,</hi> whom some of you have heard declame. This <hi>Epitherses</hi> was my Townsman and School-master, who told me, That designing a Voyage to <hi>Italy,</hi> he embark'd himself on a Vessel well laden both with Goods and Passengers. About the Evening the Vessel was becalm'd about the Isles <hi>Echinades,</hi> whereupon their Ship drove with the Tide till it was carry'd near the Isles of <hi>Paxes:</hi> When immediately a Voice was heard by most of the Passengers (who were then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and taking a Cup after Supper) calling unto one <hi>Thamus,</hi> and that with so loud a Voice, as made all the Company amazed; which <hi>Thamus</hi> was a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whose Name was scarcely known in the Ship. He returned no Answer to the Two first Calls, but at the Third he replyed, <hi>Here! here! I am the Man.</hi> Then the Voice said aloud to him, <hi>When you are arrived at</hi> Palodes, <hi>take Care to make it known, that the great</hi> God PAN <hi>is dead. Epitherses</hi> told us, this Voice did much astonish all that heard it, and caused much arguing, Whether this Voice was to be obeyed or slighted. <hi>Thamus,</hi> for his part, was resolv'd, if the Wind permitted, to sayl by the Place without saying a Word; but if the Wind ceas'd, and there ensu'd a Calm, to speak and cry out as loud as he was able what he was enjoyn'd. Being come to <hi>Palodes,</hi> there was no Wind stirring, and the Sea was as smooth as Glass. Whereupon <hi>Thamus</hi> standing on the Deck, with his Face towards the Land, uttered with a loud Voice his Message, saying, <hi>The Great</hi> PAN <hi>is dead.</hi> He had no sooner said this, but they heard a dreadful Noise, not only of one but of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46327:15"/> several, who, to their thinking, groan'd and lamented with a kind of Astonishment. And there being many Persons in the Ship, an Account of this was soon spread over <hi>Rome,</hi> which made <hi>Tiberius</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> send for <hi>Thamus,</hi> and seem'd to give such heed to what he told him, that he earnestly enquired who this PAN was. And the Learned Men about him gave in their Judgments, That 'twas the Son of <hi>Mercury</hi> by <hi>Penelope.</hi> There were some then in the Company, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, They had heard old <hi>Aemilianus</hi> say as much. <hi>Demetrius</hi> then related, That about <hi>Britain</hi> there were many small and desolate Islands, some of which were called the Isles of <hi>Daemons</hi> and <hi>Demy-Gods;</hi> and that he himself at the command of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> sailed to the nearest of those Places for Curiosity sake, where he found few Inhabitants, but that they were all esteemed by the <hi>Britains,</hi> as <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi> Not long after he was arrived there, he said, the Air and the Weather were very foul and tempestuous, and there followed a terrible Storm of Wind and Thunder; which at length ceasing, he says, the Inhabitants told him, That one of the <hi>Daemons</hi> or <hi>Demy-Gods</hi> was deceased. For, as a Lamp, said he, while 'tis lighted offends no body with its scent, but when 'tis extinguished it sends out such a Scent as is nauseous to every body; so these great Souls, whilst they shine, are mild and gracious, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being troublesom to any body; but when they draw to an end, they cause great Storms and Tempests, and not seldom infect the Air with contagious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers. They say farther, That <hi>Saturn</hi> is detained Prisoner in one of those Islands, whom he keeps fast asleep in Chains, and that he has several of those <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> for his Valets and Attendants. Thus then spake <hi>Cleombrotus;</hi> I could, says he, relate several such Stories as these, but 'tis sufficient that what has bin said as yet, does not contradict the Opinion of any one here.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46327:16"/> And we all know, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> believe the same as we do concerning the <hi>Daemons;</hi> and, that amongst the great Company of <hi>Gods</hi> which are commonly believ'd, there is but one who is <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immortal;</hi> all the rest having bin born in Time, shall end by Death. As to the Flouts and Scoffings of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> they are not to be regarded, seeing they have the Boldness to treat Divine Providence with as little Reverence, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it by no better a Name, than a mere Whimsey and old Wives Fable. Whereas we, on the contrary, assert, That their <hi>Infinite</hi> Worlds is truly ridiculous, seeing among such endless Numbers of them, there's not one governed by Reason or Divine Providence, they having been all made and upheld by Chance. If we cannot forbear drolling even in matters of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> they are most to be ridiculed, who bring into their Disputes of Natural Questions, certain deaf, blind and dumb Images, which appear they know not where nor when, which they say, proceed from Bodies, some of which are still living, and others long since dead and rotten. Now, such peoples Opinions as these, must needs be exploded and derided by all rational Men. Yet these very People shall be offended and angry at a Mans saying, There be <hi>Daemons,</hi> and that they subsist and continue a long time. Here <hi>Ammonius</hi> began to speak, saying, In my Opinion, <hi>Theophrastus</hi> was in the right, and spoke like a <hi>Philosopher</hi> and a <hi>Divine;</hi> for, whoever shall deny what he alledges, must also reject many things which are, and do often happen, though we understand not the Reasons why they do so; and granting what he offers to be true, What ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences follow hereupon? But as to what I have heard the <hi>Epicureans</hi> alledge against the <hi>Daemons</hi> which <hi>Empedocles</hi> asserts, as, That 'tis impossible they can be happy and long-liv'd if they be bad and vitiously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, because Vice in its own Nature is blind, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46327:16"/> Naturally precipitates it self into such mischeifs as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Life; that, I must tell you, is vain and idle. For if this reasoning be good, 'twill then follow, That <hi>Epicurus</hi> was a worse Man than <hi>Gorgias</hi> the <hi>Sophister,</hi> and <hi>Metrodorus</hi> than <hi>Alexis</hi> the <hi>Comic</hi> Actor; for he lived twice as long as <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> and <hi>Gorgias</hi> much longer than <hi>Epicurus.</hi> For, 'tis in another regard, we say Vertue is strong, and Vice weak, not in reference to the continuance or dissolution of the Body; for we know there are many Animals which are dull, slow and heavy, and many disorderly and lustful, which live longer than those that are more sagacious and quicker of Sence. And therefore they are much in the wrong in saying, The <hi>Divine</hi> Nature is Immortal, because it avoideth the things which are ill and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous; for they should have supposed the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature free from all possibility of falling into Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Alteration. But perhaps 'twill be thought not fair, to dispute against those that are absent; I would have therefore <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> to resume his Discourse, touching the Vanishing and Transmigration of <hi>Daemons</hi> from one Place to another. With all my heart, answered <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> but I shall now say something which will seem more absurd than any thing I have heretofore offered, although it seems to be grounded on Natural Reason; and <hi>Plato</hi> himself has touched upon it, not positively affirming it, but offering it as a probable Opinion. And seeing we are fall'n into a free Discourse, and that a Man cannot light into better Company, and a more favourable Auditory, I shall therefore tell you a Story which I heard from a Stranger, whose Acquaintance has cost me no small Sum of Mony in searching after him in diverse Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, whom at length after much Travel, I found near the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi> He would Converse with Men but once a Year, all the rest of his time (as he told me) he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46327:17"/> spent among the <hi>Nymphs, Nomades</hi> and <hi>Daemons.</hi> He was very free with me, and extreamly obliging: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw a more graceful Person in all my Life; and that which was very strange in him, was, that he was never subject to any Disease; once every Month he eat the bitter Fruit of a certain Medicinal Herb. He spake several Languages perfectly well; his Discourse to me was in the <hi>Dorick</hi> Dialect; his Speech was as charming as the sweetest Musick, and as soon as ever he opened his Mouth to speak, there issued out of it so sweet and fragrant a Breath, that all the Place was fill'd with it. Now, as to <hi>Humane</hi> Learning, such as <hi>History,</hi> &amp;c. he retained the Knowledg thereof all the Year; but as to the Gift of <hi>Divination,</hi> he was inspired there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with only one Day in the Year; in which he went down to the Sea-side, and there foretold things to come. And thither resorted to him the Princes and Great Men of all the Country, or else their Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who there attended his coming at a prefixed Day, and then returned. This Person attributed <hi>Divination</hi> to the <hi>Daemons,</hi> and was well pleased to hear what we related concerning <hi>Delphos.</hi> Whatsoever we told con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the Sacrifices which are offered to him, he knew it all, saying, That as these were great Accidents which hapned to <hi>Daemons,</hi> so also was that which was related of the Serpent <hi>Python;</hi> affirming, That he who slew him was not banished for Nine Years, neither did he fly into the Vally of <hi>Tempe,</hi> but was driven out of <hi>this</hi> World into <hi>another;</hi> from whence, after Nine Revolutions of the <hi>Great Years,</hi> being return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cleansed and purified, and become a true <hi>Phaebus,</hi> that is to say, clear and bright, he had at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Superintendance of the <hi>Delphic Oracle;</hi> which in the mean time was committed to the Charge of <hi>Themis.</hi> He said as much concerning what is related of the <hi>Typhons</hi> and <hi>Titans.</hi> For he affirmed, They
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46327:17"/> were the Battels of <hi>Daemons</hi> against <hi>Daemons,</hi> and the Flights and Banishments of those that had been vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the Punishments inflicted by the <hi>Gods</hi> on those which had committed such Facts, as <hi>Typhon</hi> is said to have done against <hi>Osiris,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> against <hi>Coelum,</hi> whose Honours are much obscured, or wholly lost, by being translated into another World. For I know that the <hi>Solymeans,</hi> who are Borderers to the <hi>Lycians,</hi> did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour <hi>Saturn;</hi> but since he kill'd their Princes, <hi>Arsalus, Dryus</hi> and <hi>Throsobius,</hi> he fled into some other Country, they knew not where, and he now is in a manner forgotten. But they called those three, <hi>Arsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Dryus</hi> and <hi>Throsobius,</hi> the severe Gods, and the <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do at this Day curse People in their Names, as well in private as public. Several other such like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples may a Man find in the Records of the Gods. And if we call any of the <hi>Daemons</hi> by the usual and common Names of the <hi>Gods</hi> on whom they do depend, 'tis no marvel at all (said this great Man) for they like to be called by the <hi>Gods</hi> on whom they do depend, and from whom they have received their Honour and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; even as amongst us Men, one is named <hi>Jovius,</hi> another <hi>Palladius</hi> or <hi>Apollonius.</hi> And there are some, who though they have their Names imposed on them, as it were by chance, yet do they well agree with their Tempers; whereas some carry the Names of the <hi>Gods,</hi> which do not at all suit with their Weaknesses and Imperfections. Here <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> having paused, his Discourse seemed strange to all the Company, and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racleon</hi> demanded of him, how this Discourse concern'd <hi>Plato,</hi> and how he had given Occasion to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course? Unto which <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> answered, You do well to put me in mind of it; for first, he ever reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Infinity of Worlds, yet would determine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing positively, touching the precise Number of them: And granting the Probability of their Opinion, who
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46327:18"/> affirmed there were Five in each Element; as to his own Part, he kept to One, which seems to be his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Opinion; whereas all other <hi>Philosophers</hi> have been afraid to receive and admit the Multitude of Worlds; as if those who did not refer and determine the Matter to One, must needs fall into this troublesome and boundless Infinity. But was this Stranger, said I, of the same Opinion with <hi>Plato,</hi> touching the Number of the Worlds? or did you not all the while ask his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that Matter? I was far from failing herein, says <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> seeing I found him so communicative and affable to me. He told me, That neither the Number of the Worlds was Infinite, neither was there but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One, nor Five, but an Hundred and Eighty three, which were ranged in a Triangular Form, every Side containing Sixty Worlds; and of the Three remaining, every Corner had One; that they were so ordered, that one always touched another in a Circle, like those who dance in a Ring; that the Plain within the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, is as it were the Foundation and common Altar to all those Worlds, which is called <hi>the Plain,</hi> or <hi>Field of Truth,</hi> in which lye the Designs, Moulds, Ideas and invariable Examples of all things which were, or ever shall be; and about these is <hi>Eternity,</hi> whence flowed <hi>Time</hi> as from a River into these Worlds. Moreover, that the Souls of Men, if they have lived well in this World, do see them once in Ten Thousand Years; and that the most Holy, Mystical Ceremonies which are performed here, are no more than a Dream of this Sacred Vision; and farther, That all the Pains which are taken in the Study of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> were to attain to a Sight of those Beauties, otherwise they were all lost Labours. I heard him, said he, relate all these things as perfectly as if they had been some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Rites, wherein he would have instructed me; for, he brought me no Proof or Demonstration to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46327:18"/> what he said. Here turning my self to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> I asked him what were the Words which the Wooers of <hi>Penelope</hi> spake in <hi>Homer,</hi> when they saw <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Bow,
<q>A cunning Spy no doubt, and Plagiary.</q> And <hi>Demetrius</hi> having put me in mind of them, it came, I say, into my Thoughts, to say as much of this wonderful Man. He was a Person conversant in all sorts of Learning, being a <hi>Greek</hi> born, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well skill'd in the Studies of his Country; for this Number of Worlds shews us, That he was neither an <hi>Indian,</hi> nor an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> but that his Father was a <hi>Greek</hi> of the Country of <hi>Sicily,</hi> named <hi>Petron,</hi> born in the City of <hi>Himera,</hi> who wrote a little Book on this Subject, which I indeed never saw, nor can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be extant. But <hi>Hippus,</hi> a Native of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Phanias</hi> the <hi>Eressian,</hi> tells us, 'twas the Doctrine of <hi>Petron,</hi> That there were an Hundred and Eighty three Worlds, whose Ends were orderly tack'd to one another; but he offers no reason to prove this. 'Tis certain, says <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that <hi>Plato</hi> himself bringing no Argument to evince this Point, does hereby over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this Opinion. Yet, says <hi>Heracleon,</hi> we have heard you <hi>Grammarians</hi> say, That <hi>Homer</hi> was the first Author of this Opinion, as having divided the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse into Five Worlds, Heaven, Water, Air, Earth, and that which he calls <hi>Olympus,</hi> of which, he leaveth Two to be common <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Earth to all <hi>beneath,</hi> and <hi>Olympus</hi> to all <hi>above,</hi> but the Three in the midst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, he attributes unto Three several <hi>Gods.</hi> In the like manner, <hi>Plato</hi> assigning unto the principal Parts of the Universe the First Forms, and most excellent Figures of the Bodies, calls them Five Worlds, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that of the <hi>Earth,</hi> of the <hi>Water, Air</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46327:19"/> that which comprehendeth all the others, which he calls <hi>Dodecaedron,</hi> which is to say, with twelve <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses;</hi> which amply extending, is of easie Motion and Capacity, its Form and Figure being very fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Revolutions of the Animal Motions. What need is there then, cry'd <hi>Demetrius,</hi> of bringing in good old <hi>Homer,</hi> for we have had Fables enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But <hi>Plato</hi> is far from calling the different Elements <hi>Five Worlds;</hi> for even where he disputes against those who assert an Infinite Number of Worlds, he affirms, There's only One, created of <hi>God,</hi> and beloved by him, consisting of Nature intire, having a perfect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, endued with Self-sufficiency, and wanting nothing; and therefore we may well think it strange, that the Truth which he spake should occasion the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of others; for had he not maintained the World<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Unity, he would in some sort have given a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to those, who affirm an Infinite Number of them; but that he asserted precisely Five, this is marvelously strange, and far from all probability, unless you can (says he, turning himself to me) clear this Point. How▪ said I, are you then resolved to drop here your first Dispute about <hi>Oracles,</hi> and to take up another of no less Difficulty. Not so neither, reply'd <hi>Demetrius,</hi> yet we must take Cognizance of this, which does as it were hold out its Hand to us, though we shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long upon it, but treat of it by the Way, and soon return to our first Discourse. First of all then I say, the Reasons which hinder us from asserting an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Number of Worlds, do not hinder us from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, That there are more than One; for as well in Many Worlds as in One, there may be <hi>Providence, Divination</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> which may intervene in the smallest Things; but most part of the grand and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Things, have, and take their Beginnings and Changes by Order, which could not be in an Infinite
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46327:19"/> Number of Worlds. And it is more conformable to Reason, to say, That <hi>God</hi> made more than One World; for, being perfectly Good, he wants neither <hi>Power</hi> nor <hi>Good Will,</hi> and least of all, <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Friendship,</hi> for they do chiefly become the Nature of the <hi>Gods.</hi> Now <hi>God</hi> hath nothing that is superfluous and useless, and therefore there must be other Inferior <hi>Gods</hi> proceeding from him, and other Worlds made by him, towards whom he must use these social Vertues; for he cannot exercise those Vertues of Justice and Benignity on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but to others; so that it is not likely this World should float and wander about, without either Friend, Neighbour, or any sort of Communication, into an Infinite <hi>Vacuum.</hi> For we see, Nature includes and contains all things in their <hi>Species,</hi> like as in Vessels, or in Husks of Seeds; for there's nothing in Nature of which there is but one and no more, but has the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its Being common with others; neither is there any thing that hath a particular Denomination, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the common Notion, it is by some particular Qualities distinct from others of the same <hi>Genus.</hi> Now, the World is not termed so in Common, it must be then such in Particular, and qualified it is in Particular, and distinguished by certain Differences, from other Worlds of the same Kind. For there being no such Thing in Nature as one Man alone, one Horse, one Star, one <hi>God,</hi> one <hi>Daemon;</hi> so there is not in Nature one only World, and no more, it being certain, that there are several. And he that shall object against me, That this World hath likewise but one Earth, and one Sea, I can answer him, He is much deceived, by not understanding the Evidence of like Parts. For we divide the Earth into Similar Parts, and of the same Denomination; for all the Parts of the Earth are Earth, and so of the Sea; but no Part of the World, is the World, it being composed of divers and different
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46327:20"/> Natures; for as to the Inconvenience which some do seem to fear, and in respect of which they confine all the Matter within One World, lest there remaining any thing without, it should disturb the Composition of this, by the Resistances and Jarrs which it would make against it; they have no need to dread this; for, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re being Many Worlds, and each of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular having one definite and determinate Measure and Limit of its Substance and Matter, no Part thereof will be without Order and good Disposition, nothing will remain superfluous, or be cast out as an Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, the Reason which belongeth to each World, being able to rule and govern the <hi>Matter</hi> that is allotted thereto, will not suffer any thing to run out of Course and Order, and rencounter and jumble ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World; nor likewise, that any thing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should justle or disturb it, there being nothing in Nature Infinite and Inordinate in Quantity, nor in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Reason and Order. And if perhaps there be any Influence that passes from the one to the other, this is a Fraternal Communication, whereby they mix themselves together, like the Light of the Stars, and the Influence of their Temperatures, which are the Cause that they themselves do rejoyce in beholding one another with a benign Aspect, and give to the <hi>Gods</hi> (who are Good and many in Number in every Star) an Opportunity of knowing and caressing one another: For there's nothing in all this that is impossible, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous, or contrary to Reason, though some may think so, because of the Opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who saith, That all Bodies have their proper and natural Places, by which means the Earth must on all sides tend to the Midst, and the Water upon it, serving by its Weight for a Foundation to the other lighter Elements. Were there then Many Worlds, the Earth would be often found to be situated above the Airy and Fiery Regions,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46327:20"/> and as often under them, sometimes in their natural Places, and sometimes in other, which are contrary to their Natures; which things being impossible (as he thinks) it follows then, there are neither Two, nor more Worlds, but One only, which is this here, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Kinds of Elements, disposed according to Nature, agreeable to the diversity of Bodies. But in all this there is more probability than Truth; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, Friend <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that when he saith among sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Bodies, some tend towards the Midst, which is to say, downwards, the others from the Midst, that is, upward, and a Third sort move round about the Midst; what does he mean by the Midst? this cannot be in respect of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> there being no such thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he says himself: And moreover, those that do allow it, say, that it can have no Middle, no more than Beginning and End; for Beginning and End are Extremities; but that which is Infinite, every Body knows is without an End. But supposing we should be necessitated to admit a Middle in a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to comprehend and imagine the different Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Bodies towards it, because there is neither in this <hi>Vacuum</hi> any Power attractive of the Body, nor in the Bodies any Inclination or Affection to tend on all Sides to this Middle: And it is no less difficult to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that Bodies can move of themselves towards an Incorporeal Place, or receive any Motion from it. This Middle then must be understood not locally, but corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>really: for this World being a Mass and Union consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of different Bodies joyned together, this Diversity of them must beget different Motions from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which appears, in that each of these Bodies chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Substance, does at the same time change its Place: For the Subtilization and Rarefaction dissipates the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which springeth from the Midst, and ariseth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: whereas on the contrary, the Condensation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46327:21"/> and Constipation depresses and drives it down towards the Middle, on which 'tis not necessary to discourse any longer in this Place; for whatever Cause a Man supposes shall produce such Passions and Changes, that very Cause will contain each of these Worlds in it self, because each of them has its Sea and Land, each its proper Middle, and each its Passions and Change of Bodies, and the Nature and Power, which contains and preserves each in its Place and Being. For that which is without, whether it be nothing at all, or an Infinite <hi>Vacuum,</hi> cannot allow any Middle, as we have already said. But there being several Worlds, each has its proper Middle apart; so that in each of them there will be Motions proper to Bodies, some tending down to the Midst, others mounting aloft from the Midst, others moving round about it, according as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do distinguish Motions. And he who asserts there are many Middles, and that heavy Bodies from all sides do tend unto one alone, is like to him who shall affirm, That the Blood of several Men runs from all Parts into one Vein; or that all their Brains should be contained within one and the same Membrane; supposing it absurd, that all Natural Bodies which are solid, should not be in one Place, and the rare in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He that thus thinketh, is certainly a mean <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher;</hi> and no better is he who will not allow the Whole to have all Parts in their Order, Rank and natural Situation. What could be more foolish, than for a Man to imagine a World which had a Moon within it, situated beneath; just as if a Man should have his Brains where his Heels are, and his Heart in his Forehead? Whereas, there's no Absurdity or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, if in supposing several distinct Worlds, separated from one another, a Man should distinguish and separate their Parts. For in each of them, the Earth, Sea and Sky, will be placed and situated in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46327:21"/> their proper Places; and each of these Worlds may have its Superior, Inferior, Circular and Middle Part; not in respect of another World, nor in reference to what is without, but what is within it self. And as to the Argument which some do draw from a Stone being placed without the World, it neither proves Rest nor Motion; for how could it remain suspended, seeing it is by Nature heavy, or move towards the Midst of the World as other ponderous Bodies, seeing it is neither part of it, nor like it? And as to that Earth which is fix'd and environed by another World, we must not wonder, considering its Weightiness, if it does not drop down, seeing it is upheld by a certain Natural Force pertaining to it. For if we shall take high and low, not within the World, but without, we shall find our selves involved in the same Difficulties as <hi>Epicurus</hi> was, when he made his little Indivisible <hi>Atoms</hi> to move and tend to those Places which are under foot, as if the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> had Feet, or that its Infinite Space would permit one to talk of high or low. Indeed a Man would marvail what should cause <hi>Chrysippus</hi> to say, That the World was placed and situated directly in the Midst; and that the Matter thereof from all Eternity, having possessed it self of the Midst, yet is so compacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that it remains for ever: For he writes this in his Fourth Book of <hi>Possible Things;</hi> vainly imagining, there's a Middle in that vast Emptiness: And still more absurdly attributing unto that Middle, which is not, the Cause of the Worlds Stability and Continuance; he having often said in other Writings of his, That the Substance is upheld and governed by the Motions tending to the Midst, and partly by others parting from the Midst of it. As to the other Oppositions which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> make, who should fear them! as when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, how 'tis possible to mantain a <hi>Fatal Destiny?</hi> a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence?</hi> and how it can be otherwise but that we
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46327:22"/> must admit of several <hi>Jupiters,</hi> when we assert the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Worlds. Now if there be an Inconveniency in admitting many <hi>Jupiters,</hi> their Opinions will appear far more absurd; For they imagine there are Suns, and Moons, <hi>Apollo's, Diana's</hi> and <hi>Neptunes,</hi> in innumerable Changes and Revolutions of Worlds. But where is the Necessity which lies upon us, to grant, That there must be many <hi>Jupiters,</hi> if there be many Worlds; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there may be in each of them a Sovereign Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Whole, indued with a suitable Mind and Ability, like to him whom we name the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of <hi>All Things?</hi> or what shall hinder us from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting, That the several Worlds be subject to the Providence and Management of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> having an Eye to all Things, directing and administring to All, the Principles, the Seeds and Causes of all Things which are made. For as we often see here a Body composed of several other distinct Bodies; for Example, the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of a Town, an Army, or a <hi>Chorus;</hi> in each of which Bodies, there's Life, Prudence, and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: so it is not impossible, that in the whole Universe, Ten, or Fifty, or a Hundred Worlds which may be in it, should all use the same Reason, and all correspond with the same Principle. For this Order and Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is very suitable to the <hi>Gods;</hi> for we must not make them Kings of a Swarm of Bees, who never stir out of their Hives; or keep them fast imprisoned in Matter, like those who affirm the <hi>Gods</hi> to be certain Dispositions of the Air, and Powers of Waters and Fire, infused and mixed within, which arise and spring up together with the World, and to be burnt in Time, and end with it, not affording them the Liberty of Coach-men and Pilots, but nailing them down to their <hi>Bases,</hi> like Statues and Images; for they inclose the <hi>Gods</hi> within Matter, and that in so strict a Manner, as makes them liable to all the Changes, Alterations and Decays of it.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46327:22"/> It is certainly more agreeable to the Nature of the <hi>Gods,</hi> to say that they are wholly at liberty, like <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> ready to succor such as are overtaken by bad Weather at Sea; for when they appear, the Winds cease, and the Waves are calmed; not that they Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigate, and are Partakers of the same Peril; but only appear in the Sky, and the Danger is over. Thus do the <hi>Gods</hi> visit each World, and rule and provide for all things in them. <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> cast not his Eyes far from the City of <hi>Troy</hi> into <hi>Thracia,</hi> and the <hi>Nomades</hi> or wandring <hi>Scythians,</hi> along the River <hi>Ister</hi> or the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube;</hi> but the true <hi>Jupiter</hi> has several seemly and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Passages for his Majesty from one World into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not looking into the Infinite <hi>Vacuum</hi> without, nor regarding himself and nothing else, as some have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, but weighing the Deeds of <hi>Gods</hi> and Men, and the Motions and Revolutions of the Stars. For the Divinity does not hate Variety and Changes, but takes great Pleasure in them, as one may conjecture by the Circuits, Conversions and Mutations observable in the Heavens. And therefore I conclude, That the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of Worlds is a <hi>Chimera,</hi> which has not the least probability of Truth, and which cannot by any means admit of One <hi>God,</hi> but must be wholly guided by Chance and Fortune. Whereas the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Providing for a certain Number, and definite Number of Worlds, has nothing in it that seems more laborious and unworthy, than that which is imploy'd and restrain'd to the Direction of One alone; which is transformed, renewed and reformed an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of Times. Having said this, I paused, and <hi>Philippus</hi> immediately cryed out, Whether this be certain or not, I will not be too positive; but, says he, if we carry <hi>God</hi> beyond On<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46327:23"/> Proportion this Number bears to that of the Worlds, than to know why the Word <hi>E I</hi> was inscribed upon this Temple For this is neither a Triangular, a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate, a Perfect, nor a Cubic Number; neither does it yield any Elegancy to such as are delighted in these kind of <hi>Sciences.</hi> And as to what concerns the Argument drawn from the Number of Elements, which <hi>Plato</hi> seems to have touched upon, 'tis obscure and improbable, and will not afford this Consequence, That as there is formed from Matter Five Sorts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Bodies, which have equal Angles, equal Sides, and environed with equal <hi>Superficies;</hi> so there was from the Beginning Five Worlds, made and formed of these Five Bodies. Yet <hi>Theodorus</hi> the <hi>Solian,</hi> reading <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Mathematicks</hi> to his Scholars, does both keep to the Text, and clearly expounds it, when he saith, The <hi>Pyramis, Octaedron, Dodecaedron, Icosaedron,</hi> (which <hi>Plato</hi> lays down as the first Bodies) are all beautiful, both in their Proportions and Equalities; Nature cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and make better than these, nor perhaps so good. Yet they have not all the same Constitution and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; for, the least of the Five is the <hi>Pyramis;</hi> the greatest, which has most Parts, is the <hi>Dodecaedron;</hi> and of the other two, the <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46327:23"/> Now the way to avoid also this Absurdity, is to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and divide the Matter into Five Worlds; here the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> (for she is the first and most simple) there the <hi>Octaedron,</hi> and there the <hi>Isocaedron,</hi> and out of that which exists first in every of these Resolutions, the rest draw their Original by the Concretion or Composition of Parts, by which every thing is changed into every thing, as <hi>Plato</hi> himself shews us by Examples throughout.

                  </gap> Passions and Transmutations of all. The Seminary or Beginning of Fire is the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> consisting of Twenty Four First Triangles, and the <hi>Octaedron</hi> is the Seminary of the Air, consisting of Forty Eight Triangles of the same Kind. So that the one Element of Air, stands upon two of Fire, joyned together and condensed: And again, One Body or Element of Air is divided into Two of Fire, which becoming still more thick and hard, is changed into Water; so that throughout, that which comes first into Light, gives easily Birth unto the rest by Transmutation: And so it comes to pass that there is not only one Cause and Principle of all things, but that one thing is so near the Seed and Origin of another, in the several Changes and Alterations of Nature by Motion, that in the last Result they are all the same. But here <hi>Ammonius</hi> interrupted him, and said, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that those things are so peremptorily and so pompously asserted by <hi>Theodorus,</hi> yet I shall wonder if he be not forced to make use of such Suppositions as are destructive of themselves, and one of another. For he will have it, that the Five Worlds he speaks of, were not composed all at one time, but that that which was subtilest, and which gave least Trouble in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, came out first into being: And as if it were a consequent, and not a repugnant thing, he supposes that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46327:24"/> the Matter does not always drive out into Existence, that which is most subtil and simple, but that sometimes the thickest, grossest and heaviest Parts do prevent and set the heat of the more subtil in Generation. But besides this, supposing there be Five Primitive Bodies or Elements, and consequently that there be as many Worlds, there are but Four of those Orders, which he discourses rationally concerning. For as to the Cube, he takes it away and removes it, as it were in a Game of Counters; for it is naturally unfit, either to turn into any thing besides it self, or to yield that any of those other Bodies be converted into it, inasmuch as the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles of which they consist, be not of the same sort; for all the rest consist in common of Demy-Triangles, or Triangles of Unequal Sides; but the proper Subject of which this is particularly composed, is the Triangle <hi>Isosceles,</hi> or equilateral, which admitteth no Inclination unto a Demy-Triangle, nor can possibly be united and incorporated with it. If there be then Five Bodies, and consequently Five Worlds, and that in each of these Worlds the Principle of Generation be that Body which is first produced; it must happen that where the Cube is the first in Generation, none of the rest can possibly be produced, it being contrary to its Nature to change into any of them. Not to insist here, that <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus</hi> and those of his Mind, make the Element, or Principle of which the <hi>Dodecaedron</hi> is composed, to be different from the rest, it not being that Triangle which is termed <hi>Scalenon,</hi> with Three unequal Sides, out of which the <hi>Pyramis, Octaedron,</hi> and <hi>Isocaedron,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Plato,</hi> are produced: So that, said <hi>Ammonius</hi> laughing, you must solve these Objections, or offer some thing new concerning the Matter in debate; and I-answered him, That for my Part, I knew not at present how to say any thing which carried more Probability; but perhaps it is better for a Man to refine and correct
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46327:24"/> his own Opinion than anothers; therefore I say then, that there being supposed from the beginning of Things Two several Natures contrary to each other, the one Sensible, Mutable, subject to Generation, Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Change every way; the other Spiritual and Intelligible, and abiding always in the same State; 'twould be very strange, my Friends, to say, That the Spiritual Nature admitteth of Division, and that it hath Diversity and Difference in it, and to be angry, if a Man will not allow the Passible and Corporal Nature to be wholly united in it self, without dividing it into many Parts; for it is most suitable to the Permanent and Divine Natures, to be tyed and linked to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to avoid, as much as is possible, all Division and Separation; and yet amongst incorporeal Natures, the Power or Vertue of one compared with another, makes greater differences than those of distance of Place, arising from several Notions and Ideas in the Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World, which answer to Local Distances in the Corporeal. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> refuting those who hold this Proposition, <hi>That all is one,</hi> asserts these Five Grounds and Principles of All; <hi>viz.</hi> Entity, Identity, Diversity, Motion and Rest, which Five Immaterial Principles being admitted, 'tis no marvel, if Nature have made every one of these to be an Imitation, though not exact, yet as perfect and agreeable as could be drawn, of a correspondent Principle in the Corporeal Mystery, partaking, as much as can be, of its Power and Virtue; for 'tis very plain, That the Cube is most proper and agreeable to Repose and Rest, by reason of the Stability and Firmness of those plain Surfaces of which it consists. And as to the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> every Body soon sees and acknowledges the Nature of Fire in it, by the slenderness of its decreasing Sides, and the sharpness of its Angles; and the Nature of the <hi>Dodecaedron,</hi> apt to comprehend all the other Figures, may seem more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46327:25"/> properly to be the Corporeal Image of <hi>Ens,</hi> or Being in the general, indifferent to this or that Particular Form or Shape. And of the other Two which remain, the <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saedron</hi> resembleth the Principle of Diversity, and the <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edron</hi> Principally partakes of the Identical Nature. And thus from one of these the Air is produced, which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of, and borders upon, every Substance, under one and the same outward Form and Appearance; and the other has afforded us the Element of Water, which by Mixture, may put on diversity of Colours, Tastes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Qualities. Therefore if Nature requires a certain Uniformity and Harmony in all things, 'tis then that there are neither more nor fewer Worlds in the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Nature, than there are Patterns or Samples in the Incorporeal; to the end that each Pattern or Sample in the Invisible Nature, may have its Primary, Radical and Original Virtue, answering and corresponding to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary or Derivative in the different Constitution or Composition of Bodies; and this may serve for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to those that wonder at our dividing Nature, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Generation and Alteration, into so many Kinds. But I intreat you all, further attentively to consider with your selves, that of the two First and Supream Principles of all Things, that is to say, the Unity, and the indefinite or indetermined Binary or Duality; this latter being the Element and chief Origin of all Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Disorder, is termed Infinity; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Nature of Unity, determining and limiting the Void Infinity, which has no Proportion nor Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, reduces it into Form, and renders it in some manner capable of receiving a Denomination, which only belongs to sensible and particular things. Now these two general Principles appear first in Number; for the Multitude is indeed no Number, but only as it is considered as a certain Form of the Matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting out of indetermin'd Infinity, by which that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46327:25"/> Infinity is cut off, and bounded within respective Limits, either shorter or longer; for then each Multitude is made Number, when once it is determined and limited by Unity, whereas if we take away Unity, then the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Duality brings all into Confusion, and renders it without Harmony, without Number or Measure. Now the Form not being the Destruction of Matter, but rather the Order and the Beauty of it, both these Principles therefore must be within Number, from whence ariseth the chief Disparity and greatest Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For the Infinite and Indeterminate Principle is the Cause of the Even Number; and the other better Principle, which is the Unity, is the Father (as it were) of the Odd Number; so that the first Even Number is Two, and the first Odd Number is Three, of which is composed Five by Conjunction, common to both; but of Power or Nature, it is not Even, but Odd. For 'twas necessary, that Nature being divided into several Parts, in order to Corporeal and Sensible Composition by the Power of the other, which is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, that it should not be either the First Even Number, nor yet the First Uneven or Odd, but a Third, consisting of both; to the end it might be procreated out of both Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> of that which causeth the Even Number, and of that which produceth the Odd; for the one cannot be parted from the other, in as much as both have the Nature, Power and Force of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. These Two Principles being then joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the best or the Triad being mightier, prevails over the Undeterminate Infinity or Duality, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth the Corporal Nature, and thus the Matter being divided, the Unity interposing it self between, has hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Universe from being divided, and parted into two equal Portions, but there have been a Multitude of Worlds caused by the Diversity and Disagreement of the Indefinite Nature; but this Multitude was brought into an Odd Number, by the Vertue and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46327:26"/> Power of Identity, or the finite Principle, and it was therefore Odd, because the better Principle would not suffer Nature to stretch it self further than 'twas fitting; for if there had been nothing but Pure and Simple, Unity, the Matter would have known no Separation, but being mixt with the dividing Nature of Duality, it has by this means received and suffered Separation and Division, yet hath stopp'd here, by the Odd Numbers being the Superior and Master to the Even; this is the Reason why the Antients were used to express Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring or Reckoning by the very <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and I am of Opinion, that the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, All, is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is to say Five; Five being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Two First Numbers, and the other Numbers being afterwards multiplied by others, they produce Numbers different from themselves: Whereas Five being multiplied by the Dyad or Even Number, produceth a perfect Ten, and multiplied by the Triad or Odd Number, it representeth it self again: Not to insist, that it is composed of the Two First Tetragones or Quadrate Numbers, <hi>viz.</hi> of Unity and Four, and that being the First Number, whose terminating Unity is equivalent to the Two Dyads before it, an Unity and a Quat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rnion being both Tetragones, as hath been said, it composeth the fairest Triangle of those that have Right Angles, and is the First Number which containeth the Sesquialteral Proportion; For perhaps all these Reasons are not very pertinent to the Discourse of the present Dispute; it being better to alledg, that in this Number there is a natural Vertue of dividing, and that Nature divideth many things by this Number. For in our Selves she has placed Five Sences, and Five Parts of the Soul, the Natural, the Sensitive, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible, the Irascible, and the Rational; and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fingers on each Hand; and the Seed disperseth it self at most but into Five, for we read no where of a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46327:26"/> Woman that brought forth more than Five at a Birth: And the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> also tell us, That the <hi>Goddess Rhea</hi> was delivered of Five <hi>Gods;</hi> giving us to understand in covert Terms, That of the same Matter were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Five Worlds. And in the Universe, the Earth is divided into Five <hi>Zones,</hi> the Heaven into Five Circles, Two <hi>Arcticks,</hi> Two <hi>Tropics,</hi> and One <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> in the Midst: That there are Five Revolutions of Planets or Wandring Stars, in as much as the Sun, <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> make but one and the same Revolution; and the Construction of the World consists of an Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Measure; even as our Musical Chords, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of the Positure of Five Tetra-Chords, ranged orderly one after another, that is to say, of <hi>Hypate, Mese, Synemmene, Diezeugmene,</hi> and <hi>Hyperbolia.</hi> The Pauses also which are used in Singing, are Five, <hi>Diesis, Semitonion, Tonus, Triemitonion</hi> and <hi>Ditonon;</hi> so that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seems to delight more in making all Things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Number of Five, than she does in producing them in a <hi>Sphaerical</hi> Form, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth. But 'twill perhaps be demanded, Why <hi>Plato</hi> reduced the Number of Five Worlds to the Five Regular Bodies or Figures; saying, That <hi>God</hi> made use of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Five, as it were transcribing and copying that in the Fabrick of the World. And then having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Doubt and Question of the Number of the Worlds, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether there be Five, or One only; he thereupon clearly shews, that his Conjecture is grounded on this Conceit of the Five Regular Bodies. If therefore we may allow Probability to his Opinion, then of Necessity, with the Diversity of these Figures and Bodies, there must presently ensue a Difference and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Motions, as himself teacheth, affirming, That whatever is subtilized or condensed, does at the same time, with its Alteration of Substance, alter and change its Place; for if from the Air there is ingendred Fire,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46327:27"/> when the <hi>Octaedron</hi> is dissolved and vanished into <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids;</hi> or, on the contrary, if the Air be produced from the Fire, press'd and squeez'd up into the Form of the <hi>Octaedron,</hi> 'tis not possible it should remain there where it was before, but flies and runs to another Place, force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and combating whatever stands in the Way to oppose it. And he shews this more clearly and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by an Example and Similitude of Fans, and such like things as drive away the Chaff from the Corn; for thus the Elements driving the Matter, and being driven by it, do always bring like to like, some taking up this Place, others that, before the World was digested as now it is. The Matter then being in that Condition, as every thing must be, where <hi>God</hi> is not present; the Five First Qualities, or First Bodies, having each their proper and peculiar Inclinations and Motions, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, not wholly and altogether, nor throughly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and separated one from another; for when all was hudled in Confusion, such as were surmounted, went continually against their Nature with the Mightier. And therefore some going on one side, and others go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other, hence has hapned, that There have been as many Portions and Distinctions, as there are divers Kinds of First Bodies; one of Fire, not wholly pure, but inclining towards the Form of Fire; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Celestial Nature, yet not wholly so, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining towards the Nature of Heaven; another of Earth, not simple and meer Earth, but inclining to the Form of Earth. But especially there was a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Water and Air, as we have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; for these went their Ways, replenished with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and strange Kinds. For God did not separate and distribute the Matter, but having found it thus carelesly dissipated in it self, and each Part being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in such great Disorder and Confusion, he ranged and ordered it into Symmetry and Proportion;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46327:27"/> and setting Reason over each as a Guardian and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, he made as many Worlds, as there were First Bodies. However, in respect to <hi>Ammonius,</hi> let these <hi>Platonical</hi> Notions pass without a severe Censure; for my part, I will never be over-zealous in this precise Number of Worlds, but this I will say, that those who hold there are more than One, yet not an Infinite Number, have as good Grounds as others; seeing the Matter does naturally spread it self, and is diffused into many Parts, not resting in one, and yet it is contrary to Reason, that it should be infinitely extended. In short, let us here be mindful, especially of the wise Precepts of the <hi>Academy,</hi> and preserve our selves so far upon such a slippery Ground, as the Controversie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Infinity of Worlds, by suspending our Assent. And when I had finished this Discourse, <hi>Demetrius</hi> said, <hi>Lamprias</hi> is very much in the Right; for the <hi>Gods</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us not with Multiplicities of Shadows and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures (as <hi>Euripides</hi> expresseth it) but even of Realities and Substances themselves, when we presume to be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, as if we understood them, in things of such weight and moment; but we must, as he advises us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our first Question, which we seem to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. For what was said concerning the <hi>Oracles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining dumb and useless, when the <hi>Daemons,</hi> who presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over them, were departed; even as we see <hi>Musical</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments yield no Harmony when the <hi>Musician</hi> does not handle them; this, I say, brings a greater Question in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Debate, namely touching the Cause and Power by which these <hi>Daemons</hi> use to make their <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesses</hi> to be ravish'd with <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> fill'd with Fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Imagination. For to say, the <hi>Oracles</hi> are silent, as being forsaken by the <hi>Daemons,</hi> is nothing, unless we be first shew'd, how (when they are present and govern them) they set them at work and make them Prophesy. <hi>Ammonius</hi> then taking up the Discourse, Do you think, said he, that the <hi>Daemons</hi> be any thing else,
<q>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:46327:28"/>Than wandring Spirits cloath'd in finest Air,</q> as <hi>Hesiod</hi> says; for as to my part, I think the same diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which there is between one Man and another, who act in a Tragedy or Comedy, is also to be found in this Life in Souls that are cloath'd with Bodies. So that there's nothing in this which is strange or contrary to Reason, If Souls meeting with other Souls do Imprint on them Visions and Apprehensions of future things; just as we shew several things already done and come to pass, and Prognosticate of those which have not yet happened, not only by the help of Speech, but also by Letters and Writings, or by a bare Touch, or a single Look, unless you <hi>Lamprias</hi> are of another Opinion: For we heard but very lately, that you discoursed at large upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with the Strangers that came lately to <hi>Lebadia,</hi> but he that gave us this Information could give us no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Account of what passed. No wonder, replyed I, for several avocations and businesses interveneing, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Oracle,</hi> and the solemn Sacrifice that was then performing, made our Discourse very broken and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. But now, says <hi>Ammonius,</hi> you have Auditors at Leisure, that are inquisitive and desirous of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so that you may speak freely, and expect all the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Ingenuity which you can desire. And the rest of the Company making the like Exhortations, having paused a while, I began after this manner; It so happened, <hi>Ammonius,</hi> that you did without your knowledg give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the Discourse which was then held; for if the <hi>Daemons</hi> be Souls and Spirits separated from Bodies, and have no Communication with them, as you affirm; but according to the Divine Poet <hi>Hesiod,</hi>
                  <q>Are our kind Guardians, walking here their Rounds;</q>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:46327:28"/> Why do we deprive the Spirits and Souls which are in Bodies, of the same Power by which <hi>Daemons</hi> may fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and foretell Things to come? For 'tis not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Souls do acquire any new Property and Power when they abandon the Bodies, wherewith they were not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed before; but rather, we should think that they had always the same Parts, but worse, when they are mixt with Bodies: some of them being inapparent and hid, and others weak and obscure, and which, like those Who see through a thick Mist, or move in some moist and waterish Substance, do heavily and uneasily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Operations, much desiring to be cured, and so recover what is their own, and to be discharged and purified of that which covers them. For, the Soul, whilest 'tis fastned to the Body, has the Power of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning future Things, were it not blinded by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it has to the Earthiness of the Body. For, as the Sun does not then properly become bright, when he has escaped out of the Cloud (for he is always so, though to our Eyes, being clouded, he seems obscure and dark) So the Soul acquires not then the Faculty of Divining, when gotten clear of the Body, as from a Cloud, but having the same before, is blinded by the Commixture and Confusion which she has with the Mortal Body: And this cannot seem strange or incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, if we consider nothing else in the Soul, but the Faculty of Remembrance, which is, as it were, the reverse of Divination, and if we reflect upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Power it hath of preserving Things past, or rather of making those Things to exist which are not; for of what is past there is nothing remains, and all things do exist and perish in the same Moment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Actions, or Words, or Passions; they all pass by and vanish as soon as they appear; for Time, like the Course of a River, passeth on, and carries eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing along with it. But this Retentive Faculty
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46327:29"/> of the Soul resisting, and as it were, making Head against it, gives a Being to those Things which are not present. For the <hi>Oracle</hi> which was given to those of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> touching <hi>Arna,</hi> enjoyned them to call her
<q>The Deaf Man's Hearing, and the Blind Man's Sight.</q> But Memory is to us the Hearing of the Deaf, and the Sight of the Blind; so that as I now said, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, if retaining the Things which are no longer in Being, the Soul anticipates several of those which are still to come; for these do more concern her, and she does naturally sympathize with them, inclining and tending to things which are future; whereas, as to those which are past, and have an end, she leaves them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her, only retaining the bare Remembrance of them. Our Souls then having this inbred Power, tho weak, obscure, and hardly able to express their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions; yet sometimes they spread forth and recover themselves, either in Dreams, or in the time of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Religious Worship, when the Body is well pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and is endued with a certain Temperature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this Effect; or when the Rational or Speculative Part being released and freed from the Solicitude after present Things, joyneth with the Irrational and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Part, to think of, and represent what's to come; for it is not, as <hi>Euripides</hi> saith, that he is the best Prophet who guesses well; but he's the wisest Man, not whose Guess succeeds well in the Event, but who, whatever the Event be, takes Reason and Probability for his Guide. Now the Faculty of Divining, like Blank Paper, is void of any Reason, or Determination of it self, but is susceptible of Fantasies and Prae-sensions, and without any Ratiocination or Discourse of Reason, touches on that which is to Come, when it is farthest off from the Present, out of which it departs, by means of a certain
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46327:29"/> Disposition of Body, which we call Inspiration or <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm.</hi> Now the Body is sometimes endued naturally with this Disposition; but most times the Earth casts forth to Men the Sourses and Causes of several other Powers and Faculties, some of which carry Men besides themselves into Exstacy and Phrenzy, and produce Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies and Mortalities; others again are sometimes good, gentle and profitable, as appears by those who have had the Experience of them. But this Spring or Wind, or Spirit of Divination, is most Holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, whether it be raised by it self through the Air, or be compounded and mixt with a watry or liquid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. For, being infused and mixed with the Body, it produceth an odd Temperature and strange Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Soul, which a Man cannot exactly express, though he may resemble or compare it to several things; for by Heat and Dilatation it openeth certain Pores that make a Discovery of future things; like Wine, which causing Fumes to ascend up into the Head, puts the Spirits into many unusual Motions, and reveals things that were laid up in secret; for Drunkenness and Phrenzy, if we will believe <hi>Euripides,</hi> have a near Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Nature of Divination, when the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot and fiery, banishes those Fears, to which Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Sobriety are subject, and which extinguish and quench the Spirit of Divination. Furthermore, a Man may say, that Dryness being mixt with Heat, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuateth and subtilizeth the Spirit, and makes it pure, and of an Etherial Nature and Consistence; for the Soul it self, according to <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> is of a dry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; whereas Moisture does not only dim the Sight, and dull the Hearing, but when mingled with the Air, and touching the <hi>Superficies</hi> of Mirrors, dusk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Brightness of the One, and takes away the Light of the Other. Or perhaps on the contrary, by some Refrigeration and Condensation of this Spirit,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46327:30"/> like the Tincture and Hardness of Iron; this Part of the Soul which does prognosticate, may shew it self, and get a perfect Edge. Just as Tin being melted with Brass (which of it self is a Metal in the Oar, rare, spongious and full of little Holes) does drive it nearer and make it more massy and solid, and withal, causeth it to look more bright and resplendent; so I cannot see any Reason, why this Prophetical Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having some Congruence and Affinity with Souls, may not fill up that which is lax and empty, and drive it more close together. For there are many things which have a Reference and Congruity one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Bean, which is agreeable to the Colour of Purple; Sal-Nitre is very useful in the Tincture of Scarlet or Crimson Colour, if it be mixt therewith, and, as <hi>Empedocles</hi> says,
<q>Fine Silk is dy'd with Saffron's azure Flow'r.</q> And we have learnt of you, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that only the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Cydnus</hi> cleaneth the Knife consecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> in the City of <hi>Tarsus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and that there's no other Water which can scour and cleanse it. So in the Town of <hi>Olympia,</hi> they temper Ashes with the Water of the River <hi>Alpheus,</hi> with which they make a Mortar, wherewith they plaister the Altar there; but if this be attempted to be done by the Water of any other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is all to no purpose. 'Tis no wonder then, if the Earth sending up many Exhalations, only those of this sort transport the Soul with a Divine Fury, and give them a Faculty of foretelling future Things. And without doubt, what is related touching the <hi>Oracle</hi> of this Place, does herewith agree. For 'tis here where this Faculty of Divining first shew'd it self, by means of a certain Shepherd, who chanced to fall down,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46327:30"/> and began to utter Enthusiastick Speeches concerning future Events; of which, at first the Neighbours took no Notice; but when they saw what he foretold came to pass, they had him in Admiration; and the most learned among the <hi>Delphians,</hi> speaking of this Man, are used to call him by the Name of <hi>Coretas.</hi> The Soul seems to me to mix and joyn it self with this <hi>Prophetick</hi> Exhalation, just as the Eye is affected with the Light: For, the Eye which has a natural Property and Faculty of Seeing, would be wholly useless without the Light; so the Soul having this Faculty and Property of Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing future things, as an Eye, has need of a proper Object, which may enlighten and sharpen it. And therefore the Ancients took the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> to be the same God; and those who understand the Beauty and Wisdom of Analogy or Proportion, do tell us, that as the Body is to the Soul, the Sight to the Mind, the Soul to Truth, so is the <hi>Sun</hi> with Reference to <hi>Apollo;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming him to be the Off-spring, proceeding perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Apollo,</hi> and representing him perpetually to the World. For as the Sun enlightens and excites the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Powers of the Senses, so <hi>Apollo</hi> does excite the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Vertue in the Soul. Those then that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined 'twas one and the same <hi>God,</hi> have with good Reason, dedicated and consecrated this Oracle to <hi>Apollo</hi> and to the Earth, deeming it to be the Sun which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed this Temperature and Disposition on the Earth, from whence arose this Predictive Exhalation. For as <hi>Hesiod,</hi> with far better Reason than other <hi>Philosophers</hi> calls the Earth,
<q>The well-fixt Seat of all Things:—</q> So do we esteem it Eternal, Immortal and Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But as to the Vertues and Faculties which are in it, we believe that some fail in one Place, and spring up
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46327:31"/> anew in another. It seems also (for so some Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments incline us to conjecture) that these Transitions, Changes and Revolutions, in process of Time, do cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate and return to the same Place, and begin again where they left off. In some Countries we see Lakes and whole Rivers, and not a few Fountains and Springs of hot Waters, have sometimes failed and been intirely lost, and at others, have fled and absconded themselves, being hidden and concealed under the Earth; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some years after do appear again in the same Place, or else run hard by. And so of Mettal-Mines, some have been quite exhausted, as the Silver ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Attica;</hi> and the same has happened to the Veins of Brass-Oar in <hi>Euboea,</hi> of which the best Blades were made, and hardned in cold Water, as the Poet <hi>Aeschylus</hi> tells us,
<q>Taking his Sword, a right <hi>Euboean</hi> Blade.</q>
'Tis not long since the Quarry of <hi>Carystus</hi> has ceased to yield a certain soft Stone, which was wont to be drawn into a fine Thread; for I suppose some here have seen Towels, Net-work, and Quoifs woven of that Thread, which could not be burnt; but when they were soil'd with using, People flung them into the Fire, and took them thence white and clean, the Fire only purifying them. But all this is vanish'd, and there's nothing but some few Fibres of hairy Threads lying up and down scatteringly in the Grain of the Stones, to be seen now in the Quarry. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Followers affirm, That the Cause of all this proceeds from an Exhalation within the Earth, which when it fails, or removes to another Place, or revives and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it self again, the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> proceeding from them do so too. The same must we say of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Exhalations which spring from the Earth,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46327:31"/> that their Virtue also is not Immortal, but may wax old and decay; for 'tis not unlikely, that great Floods of Rain and Showrs do extinguish them, and that the Claps of Thunder do dissipate them; or else, which I look upon to be the Principal Cause, they are sunk low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into the Earth, or utterly destroyed by the Shock of Earth-quakes and the Confusion that attends them, as here in this Place there still remain the Tragical Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that great Earthquake that overthrew the City. And in the Town of <hi>Orchomenus,</hi> they say, that when the Pestilence carried away such Multitudes of People, the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Tiresias</hi> of a sudden ceased, and remains mute to this day. And whether the like has not happened to the <hi>Oracles</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> as we have heard it hath, no Man can better inform us than you, <hi>Demetrius.</hi> I cannot tell, says <hi>Demetrius,</hi> how things are at present in those Parts, for you all know I have been long absent from thence; but when I was there, both that of <hi>Mopsus</hi> and of <hi>Amphilochus</hi> flourished, and were in great Esteem. And as to the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Mopsus,</hi> I can from my own Knowledge tell you a strange Story went about it. The Governour of <hi>Cilicia</hi> was a Man inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Scepticism,</hi> and doubtful whether there be <hi>Gods;</hi> and had about him several <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who are wont to mock at the Belief of such Things, as seem contrary to Reason. He sent a freed Servant of his in the Nature of a Spy, with a Letter seal'd, wherein was the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion he was to ask the <hi>Oracle,</hi> no Body knowing the Contents thereof. This Man then, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Custom of the Place is, remaining all Night in the Temple-Porch asleep, related the next Morning the Dream which he had; for he thought he saw a very handsome Man stand before him, who said only this Word, <hi>Black,</hi> to him, and nothing else, for he vanish'd away immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. This seemed to us very impertinent, though we could not tell what to make of it; but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46327:32"/> marvelled at it, and was so netled with it, that he had the <hi>Oracle</hi> in great Veneration ever since; for, opening the Letter, he shew'd this Question which was therein; <hi>Shall I sacrifice to thee a White Bull or a Black?</hi> which dash'd his <hi>Epicureans</hi> quite out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and he offered the Sacrifice required, and to the Day of his Death continued a devout Admirer of <hi>Mop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Demetrius</hi> had given us this Relation, he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld his Peace; and I being desirous to put an end to this Conference, cast mine Eyes on <hi>Philippus</hi> and <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who sate together, and they, I thought, look'd as if they had something to say to me, and therefore I kept silent. With that, <hi>Ammonius, Philippus,</hi> says he, <hi>Lamprias</hi> hath something to offer touching what hath been debated, for he thinks, as well as other Folks, That <hi>Apollo</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> are the same <hi>God;</hi> but the Question which I propose is of greater Consequence; for just now in our Discourse, we have taken away Divination from the <hi>Gods,</hi> and openly attributed it to the <hi>Daemons,</hi> and now we are for excluding of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and dispossessing them of the <hi>Oracle</hi> and <hi>Three-footed-Stool,</hi> referring the Cause, or rather the Nature and Essence of Divination to Exhalations, Winds, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors; for these Opinions carry us still farther off from the <hi>Gods,</hi> introducing such a Cause of this Event, as <hi>Euripides</hi> makes <hi>Polyphemus</hi> to alledge in his <hi>Tragedy</hi> of <hi>Cyclops;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>The Earth by force, whether she will or no,</l>
                     <l>Shall for my Cattle make the Grass to grow.</l>
                  </q> Yet he does not say that he sacrificed his Herds to the <hi>Gods,</hi> but to himself and his own Belly, the greatest of all <hi>Daemons;</hi> whereas we offer them Sacrifices and Prayers for to obtain an Answer from their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46327:32"/>
                  <hi>Oracles;</hi> but to what purpose, if it be true, that Souls are naturally endued with the Faculty of Prediction, and that the chief Cause that excites this Faculty and Vertue, is a certain Temperature of Air or Wind? and what signifies then the sacred Institutions and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apart these Religious <hi>Prophetesses,</hi> for the giving of Answers? And why do they return no Answer at all, unless the Sacrifice tremble all over, even from the very Feet, whilst the Wine is poured on its Head? For 'tis not enough to wag the Head, as other Beasts do, which are appointed for Sacrifices; but this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and shivering must be universal, throughout all Parts of the Body, and that with a trembling Noise; for if this be not done, they say that the <hi>Oracle</hi> will give no Answer, neither is the <hi>Pythia</hi> or Priestess introduced. For, it is very proper and suitable for them to do and believe thus, who ascribe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses of Prophetical Inspiration either to a <hi>God</hi> or a <hi>Daemon;</hi> but by no means for those that are of your Opinion. For the Exhalation which springeth out of the Ground, whether the Beast tremble or not, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, if it be present, cause a Ravishment and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport of Spirit, and dispose the Soul alike, not only of <hi>Pythia,</hi> but of any one else that first cometh, or is presented. And it must needs seem absurd to set apart one certain Woman for the delivery of these <hi>Oracles,</hi> and to oblige her to Virginity and Chastity all her days, when the thing is referred to such a Cause, as in which all People are, or may be equally concerned. For as to that <hi>Coretas,</hi> whom the <hi>Delphians</hi> will needs have to be the first that hapned to fall into this Chink or Crevass of the Ground, and gave the first Proof of the Vertue of the Place; he, I say, seems to me not at all to differ from other Herds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Shepherds, supposing what is reported of him to be true, as I believe it is not. And truly, when I
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46327:33"/> call to mind of what Benefit this <hi>Oracle</hi> has been unto the <hi>Greeks,</hi> not only in their Wars, and building of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but also in the Stresses of Plague and Famine; methinks it is very unfit to refer its Invention and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal unto meer Chance, rather than to <hi>God</hi> and Divine Providence. But I would willingly have you, <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prias,</hi> says he, to speak on this Point, and I pray you, <hi>Philippus,</hi> to have Patience awhile. With all my heart, reply'd <hi>Philippus,</hi> and I dare undertake the same for all the Company. And as to my Part, quoth I, Oh <hi>Philippus!</hi> I am not only much mov'd, but also ashamed, considering my Youth, in the Presence of so many wise and grave Personages, to appear as if I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by Sophistry to impose upon them, and to destroy and evacuate what Sage Men have determined concerning the Divine Nature and Power; but though I am Young, yet <hi>Plato</hi> was Old and Wise as you are, and he shall be my Example and Advocate in this Case, who reprehended <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> for applying himself too much to Natural Causes, always following and pursuing the Necessary and Material Cause of the Passions and Affections incident to Bodies, and omitting the <hi>Final</hi> and <hi>Efficient,</hi> which are much better and more considerable Principles than the other; but <hi>Plato</hi> either first, or most of all the Philosophers, hath joyned both of these Principles together, attributing to <hi>God,</hi> the Causality of all Things that are according to Reason, and yet not depriving Matter of a Necessary or Passive Concurrence; but acknowledging, that the adorning and disposing of all this sensible World, does not depend on one single and simple Cause; but took its being from the Conjunction and Fellowship of Matter with Reason, which may be illustrated by the Works of Art: As for Example, without going any further, the Foot of the famous Cup which is amongst the Treasury of this Temple, which <hi>Herodotus</hi> calls <hi>Hypocrateridion,</hi> that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46327:33"/> has for the Material Cause Fire and Iron, and Pliable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by means of Fire, and the Tincture in Water, without which, such a Piece of Work could not be wrought. But the Principal Cause, and that which is most properly so called, which wrought by all these, was Art and Reason. And we see the Name of the Artist set on such their Pieces, according to that,
<q>
                     <l>'Twas <hi>Thasian Polygnote, Agalophon</hi>'s Son,</l>
                     <l>That drew this Draught of conquer'd <hi>Illum:</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q> But yet without Colours mixt and confounded with one another, it had been impossible to have done a Piece so pleasing to the Eye. Should one come then and inquire into the Material Cause, searching into, and discoursing concerning the Alterations and Mutations which the Ochre receives mixt with the Vermilion, or the Black with the Ceruss; does he thereby lessen the Credit of the Painter <hi>Polignotus?</hi> And so he that shall discourse how Iron is both hardned and mollifyed, and how being softned in the Fire, it becomes obedient to them, who by beating it, drive it out in Length and Breadth, and afterwards being plung'd into fresh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the Coldness of it, becomes hardned after it was softned and ratified by the Fire, and acquires a Firmness and Temper, which <hi>Homer</hi> calls the Strength of the Iron; does he, because of this, e're the less attribute the Cause of the Work to the Work-man? I do not think he does, for those who examine the Vertues and Properties of Medicinal Drugs, do not thereby condemn the Art of Physic. Just as <hi>Plato,</hi> when he says, that we see because the Light of the Eye is mixed with the Clearness of the Sun, and that we hear by the Percussion of the Air; yet this does not hinder, but that we have the Faculty of Seeing and Hearing from Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In a Word, Generation, as I have said, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46327:34"/> from Two Causes, the chiefest and most ancient <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> have stuck only to the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>most excellent</hi> of these, having on all Occasions these known Words in their Mouths,
<q>
                     <hi>Jove,</hi> the Beginning, Middle, Sourse of all.</q> But as to the <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Natural Causes,</hi> they concern not themselves with them. Whereas their Successors, who were for that reason called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi> took a different Course; for they forsaking this admirable and Divine Principle, ascribe all Matter, and the Passions of it, to the Motions, Mutations and Mixtures of its Parts. So that both of these are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in their Methods, because they omit, through Ignorance or Design, the one the Efficient, the others the Material Cause. Whereas, he that first pointed at both Causes, and manifestly joyned with the <hi>Reason</hi> which freely operateth and moveth the <hi>Matter,</hi> which necessarily is Obedient and Passive, does defend both himself and us from all Calumny and Censure. For we do not deprive Divination either of <hi>God</hi> or of <hi>Reason;</hi> seeing we allow it for its Subject, the Soul of Man, and for its Instrument, an <hi>Enthusiastic</hi> Exhalation. For first, the Earth, out of which Exhalations are generated, and then the Sun, which in and upon the Earth works all the infinite Possibilities of Mixture and Alteration, are, in the Divinity of our Fore-fathers, esteemed <hi>Gods.</hi> And hereunto if we add the <hi>Daemons</hi> as Superintendants and Guardians of this Temperature, as of an Harmony and Consort, who in due time slacken or stretch the Vertue of this Exhalation; sometimes taking from it the too great Activity which it has to torment the Soul, and transport it beyond it self, and mingling with it a Vertue of moving, without causing Pain to those that are possessed with it; in all this, it seems to me, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46327:34"/> we do nothing that can look strange or impossible, or unagreeable to Reason; and when we offer Sacrifices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to the <hi>Oracle,</hi> and crown them with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Flowers, and pour Wine on their Heads, I see we do not any thing in all this that is absurd or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to this Opinion of ours. For, the <hi>Priests</hi> who offer the Sacrifices, and pour out the Holy Wine thereon, and observe their Motions and Tremblings, do this for another reason, besides that of receiving an Answer from the Oracle. For the Animal which is offered to the <hi>Gods,</hi> must be pure, intire and sound, both as to Soul and Body. Now 'tis not very hard to discover the Marks of the Body; and as to the Soul, they make an Experiment of it, in setting Meal before the Bulls, and presenting Pease to the Swine; for if they will not taste them, 'tis a certain Sign they be not sound. As to Goats, cold Water is a Tryal for them; for if the Beast does not seem to be moved and affected when the Water is poured upon her, this is an evident Sign that her Soul is not right according to Nature. And supposing it should be granted, That 'tis a certain and unquestionable Design, that <hi>God</hi> will give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, when the Sacrifice thus drenched stirs, and that when it is otherwise, he vouchsafes none; I do not see herein any thing that disagrees with the Account of <hi>Oracles,</hi> which I have given. For every natural Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue produceth the Effect, be it better or worse, to which it is ordained, according as its Season is more or less proper; and 'tis likely <hi>God</hi> gives us Signs whereby we may know, Whether the Opportunity be gone or not. As for my Part, I believe the Exhalation it self, which comes out of the Ground, is not always of the same Kind, being at one time slack, and at another strong and vigorous; and the Truth of that Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I use to prove it, is attested by several Strangers, and by all those which serve in the Temple.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46327:35"/> For the Room where those do wait who come for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers from the <hi>Oracle,</hi> is sometimes, though not often, and at certain stated times, but as it were by Chance, filled with such a fragrant Odour and Scent, that no Perfumes in the World can exceed it, and this arises as it were out of a Spring, from the Sanctuary of the Temple. And this proceeds very likely from its Heat, or some other Power or Faculty which is in it; and if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure this seems to any Body an unlikely thing, however such a one will allow, that the Prophetess <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> hath that Part of the Soul, unto which this Wind and Blast of Inspiration approacheth, moved by variety of Passions and Affections, sometimes after one sort, and sometimes another; and that she is not always in the same Mood and Temper, like a sixt and immutable Harmony, which the least Alteration or Change of such and such Proportions destroys. For there are several Vexations and Passions which agitate Bodies, and slide into the Soul, that she perceives, but more that she does not; in which case 'twould be better, that she would tarry away, and not present her self to this Divine Inspiration, as not being clean, and void of all Perturbations, like an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Musick exquisitely made, but at present in disorder and out of Tune. For Wine does not at all times alike surprize the Drunkard, neither does the Sound of the Flute always affect in the same manner, him who dances to it. For the same Persons are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, and sometimes less transported beyond them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and more or less inebriated, according to the present Disposition of their Bodies; but especially the <hi>Imaginative</hi> Part of the Soul, which receives the <hi>Species,</hi> is subject to change and sympathise together with the Body, as is apparent from Dreams; for sometimes we are mightily troubled with many and confused Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our Dreams, and at other times, there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Calm, undisturbed by any such Images or Ideas.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46327:35"/> We all know <hi>Cleon</hi> a Native of <hi>Daulia,</hi> who used to say of himself, that in the many years in which he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he never had any Dream. And among the <hi>Ancients,</hi> the same is related of <hi>Thrasymedes</hi> of <hi>Haerea,</hi> the Cause of which, lyes in the Complexion and Constitution of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as is seen by melancholy People, who are much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Dreams in the Night, and their Dreams sometimes prove true. Inasmuch as such Persons Fancies run some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on one thing, and otherwhiles on another, they must thereby of necessity now and then light right, as they that shoot often must hit sometimes. When therefore the <hi>Imaginative</hi> Part of the Soul, and the Prophetic Blast or Exhalation have a sort of Harmony and Proportion with each other, so as the one, as it were in the Nature of a Medicament, may operate upon the other; then happens that Enthusiasm or Divine Fury, which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable in Prophets and Inspired Persons. And on the contrary, when the Proportion is lost, there can be no Prophetical Inspiration, or such as is as good as none; for then 'tis a forced Fury, not a natural one, but violent and turbulent, as we have seen to have hapened in the Prophetess <hi>Pythia,</hi> who is lately deceased. For certain Pilgrims being come for an Answer from the <hi>Oracle,</hi> 'tis said the Sacrifice indured the first Effusion without stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or moving a Jot, which made the <hi>Priests,</hi> out of an Excess of Zeal, to continue to pour on more, till the Beast was almost drowned with cold Water; but what hapned hereupon to the Prophetess <hi>Pythia?</hi> She went down into the <hi>Hole</hi> against her Will, but at the first Words which she uttered, she plainly shewed by the hoarsness of her Voice, that she was not able to bear up against so strong an Inspiration (like a Ship under Sail, opprest with too much Wind) but was possest with a dumb and evil Spirit; and finally, being horribly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, and running with dreadful Screeches towards the Door to get out, she threw her self violently on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46327:36"/> the Ground, so that not only the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> fled for fear, but also the High Priest <hi>Nicander,</hi> and the other <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> which were there present; who entring within a while, took her up, being out of her Senses; and indeed she lived but few days after. For these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons it is, that <hi>Pythia</hi> is obliged to keep her Body pure and clean from the Company of Men, there being no Stranger permitted to converse with her. And before she goes to the <hi>Oracle,</hi> they are used by certain Marks, to examine whether she be fit or no, believing that the <hi>God</hi> certainly knows when her Body is disposed and fit to receive, without endangering her Person, this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastical Inspiration. For, the Force and Vertue of this Exhalation, does not move all sorts of Persons, nor the same Persons in like manner, nor as much at one time as at another; but only gives beginning, and as it were kindles those Spirits which are prepared and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to receive its Influence. Now this Exhalation is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Divine and Celestial, but yet not Incorruptible and Immortal, and Proof against the <hi>Series</hi> of Time, which subdues all Things below the Moon, and, as some say, all Things above it; which growing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in an infinite Space of Duration, are suddenly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and changed. But these things, said I, I must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you and my self often and seriously to consider of, they being liable to many Disputes and Objections, which our Leisure will not suffer to particularize; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must remit them, together with the Questions which <hi>Philippus</hi> proposes, touching <hi>Apollo</hi> and the <hi>Sun,</hi> to another Opportunity.</p>

For the greater part of Men are ignorant, even of this most common and ordinary thing, for what reason the Priests lay aside their Hair, and go in Linen Garments; some are not at all solicitous to be informed about such Questions; and others say their Veneration for<note n="*" place="margin">The Ram being sacred to the Sun by the Name of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and the Ewe to the Moon, by the Name of <hi>Sais</hi> or <hi>Minerva,</hi> their Deities more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly inspiring those Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</note> Sheep is the Cause they abstain from their Wooll as well as their Flesh, and that they shave their Heads in token of Mourning, and that they wear Linen because of the bloomy Colour which the Flax sendeth forth, in imitation of that Etherial Clarity that environs the World.

It would be therefore an Absurdity for them to lay aside their own Hair in Purgations, by shaving themselves, and by making their Bodies all over smooth, and yet in the mean time to wear
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46327:38"/> and carry about them the Hairs of Brutes. For we ought to think that the Poet <hi>Hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od,</hi> when he saith;

But now the Priests do so abhor all kinds of superfluous Excrements, that they not only decline most sorts of Pulse, and of Flesh, that of Sheep and Swine, which produce much Superfluity; but also in the time of their Purgations, exclude Salt from their Meals.

But now that that Nature which hath Life, and which sees and hath the Source of her Motion from her own Self, as also the Knowledge of things Proper and Aliene to her, hath certainly derived an Efflux, and a Portion of that Prudence which (as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> speaks) <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders how both it self and the whole is govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And there the Deity is no worse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in these Animals than in the Workmanships of Copper and Stone, which suffer Corruptions and Decays as well as they, and are besides naturally void of Sense and Perception. This then is what I esteem the best account that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of their Adoration of Animals. As to the Sacred Vestments, that of <hi>Isis</hi> is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46327:86"/> party-coloured, and of different Hues; for her Power is about Matter, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes every thing, and receives every thing, as Light, Darkness, Day, Night, Fire, Water, Life, Death, Beginning and Ending; but that of <hi>Osiris</hi> hath no Shade nor variety of Colours, but one only sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple one, resembling Light. For the first Principle is untempered, and that which is First, and of an Intelligible Nature is unmixt, which is the reason why after they have once made use of these things, they lay them up and keep them close. For that which is Intelligible is invisible, and not to be toucht. But those of <hi>Isis</hi> are used often: For sensible things being of dayly use and familiar to us, afford us many Overtures and Scenes of their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; but the apprehension of what is Intelligible, Sincere and Holy, darting through the Soul like a Flash of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, attends but to some one single Glance or Glimpse of its Object. For which reason, both <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi> call this part of Philosophy by the Name of the <hi>Epoptick</hi> or Intuitive Part, intimating, that those who by help of Reason, have got beyond these Opinable, mixed and various things, mount up to that First, Simple and Immaterial Being; and when they have certainly reached the pure Truth about it, they believe they have at last attained to compleat Philosophy.

But he himself is at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest distance from the Earth imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being unstained and unpolluted, and clean from every Substance that is liable to Corruption and Death. But Mens Souls, encompassed here with Bodies and Passions, have no Communication with God, except what they can reach to in Conception on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by means of Phylosophy, as by a kind of an obscure Dream. But when they are loosed from the Body, and removed into the Unseen, Invisible, Impassible and Pure Region, this God is then their Leader and King, they there as it were hanging on him wholly, and beholding without Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness, and passionately affecting that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that cannot be exprest or uttered by Men; which the Goddess <hi>Isis</hi> alway ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressing, affecting and enjoying, by that means filled these lower things with all those goodly and excellent Beings, which partake of Generation. This then is that account of these things which best suits the Nature of the Gods. And if I now must, according to my Promise, speak something concerning the things they daily offer by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46327:87"/> way of Incense, you are in the first place to understand this, that these People make the greatest account imaginable of all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that relate to Health: and more especially in their Sacrifices, Purgations and Diets, Health is then no less respected than Devotion. For they think it would be an unseemly thing to wait upon that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is pure and every way unblemisht and untoucht, with crazy and diseased Minds or Bodies; whereas therefore the Air that we most use and live in, hath not always the same Disposition and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament; but in the Night time grow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And perceiving again at Noon-time, that the Sun hath drawn up by violence, a copious and gross Exhalation out of the Earth, they by censing, mix Myrrh also with the Air; for Heat dissolves and dissipates that puddled and slimy Vapour, which at that time gathers together in the Ambient.

For <hi>Brasidas,</hi> as History reports, drawing forth the Javelin out of his own Body, with the same Javelin, not only wounded him that threw it, but slew him out right. But as for our selves, with far less Difficulty may we defend, with far more Ease may we revenge our selves on them that pelt us with absurd and fallacious Reasonings; and it will be sufficient that we shake them off, before they reach the Opinion it self. Then said I, which of his Sayings is it, that has given you the greatest Cause to be moved? For the Man writes of many things confusedly, but of nothing in order, gleaning up and down from this and t'other Place, without Method or Judgment, and suffering himself, as it were in the Transports of his Pride and Choler, to wreck his reproachful Malice upon the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> To which <hi>Patrocleas,</hi> The slowness of the Supream Deity, said he, and his Procrastination in reference to the Punishment of the Wicked, seems to me a Point, so deeply mysterious, that it has long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd my thoughts; but now puzl'd by these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he produces, I am as it were a Stranger to the Opinion, and newly beginning again to learn. Formerly I could not with patience hear that Expression of <hi>Euripides.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>—If they delay and slowly move,</l>
                  <l>'Tis but the Nature of the Gods above.</l>
               </q>
               <p>For indeed it becomes not the Supream Deity to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss in any thing, but more especially in the Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Wicked, since they themselves are no way negligent or dilatory in doing Mischief, but always dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on by the most rapid Impetuosities of their Passions to Acts of Injustice. For certainly, according to the Saying of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> that Revenge which follows Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry closest at the Heels, presently puts a Stop to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46327:90"/> of such as make Advantage of successful Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Therefore there is no Debt, with so much Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice put off, as that of Justice, for it weakens the Hopes of the Person wrong'd, and renders him Comfortless and Pensive, but heightens the Boldness and daring Insolence of the Oppresser: whereas on the other side, those Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments and Chastisements that immediately withstand presuming Violence, not only restrain the committing of future Outrages, but more especially bring along with them a particular Comfort and Satisfaction to the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Which makes me no less troubl'd at that same Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Bias,</hi> which frequently comes into my Mind: For, said he, once, to a notorious Reprobate, 'tis not that I doubt but thou wilt suffer the just Reward of thy Wickedness, but I fear that I my self shall not live to see it. For what did the Punishment of <hi>Aristocrates</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the <hi>Messenians,</hi> who were kill'd before it came to pass? who having betray'd them at the Battle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> yet remain'd undetected for above twenty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and all that while raign'd King of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> till at length, discover'd and apprehended, he receiv'd the merited Recompence of his Treachery. But alas! they whom he had betray'd were all dead at the same time. Or when the <hi>Orchomenians</hi> had lost their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their Friends and Familiar Acquaintance, through the Treachery of <hi>Lyciscus,</hi> what Consolation was it to them, that many years after, a foul Distemper seiz'd the Traitor, and fed upon his Body, till it had consum'd his putrify'd Flesh? who, as often as he dipt and bath'd his Feet in the River, with horrid Oaths and Execrations, bann'd the Loss of his Members, putrify'd and gangreen'd to expiate the Treachery and Villany which himself had committed. For it was not possible for the Childrens Children of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who had been murther'd long before, to behold the Bodies of those Sacrilegious Caitiffs, which were afterwards torn
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46327:91"/> out of their Graves, and transported beyond the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of their native Soil. Whence in my Opinion, <hi>Euripides</hi> absurdly makes use of these Expressions, to divert a Man from Wickedness.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>If thou fear'st Heav'n, thou fear'st in vain;</l>
                  <l>Justice is not so hasty, foolish Man,</l>
                  <l>To pierce thy Heart, or with contagious Wound,</l>
                  <l>Or thee, or weaker Mortals to confound:</l>
                  <l>But with slow pace, and creeping Feet cuts off</l>
                  <l>The Malefactor, then Chastisement-proof.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And I am apt to perswade my self, that upon these, and no other Considerations it is, that wicked Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and give themselves the Liberty to attempt and commit all manner of Impieties, seeing that the Fruit which Injustice yields is soon ripe, and offers it self ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Gatherers Hand; whereas Punishment comes late, and lagging long behind the Pleasure of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Patrocleas</hi> had thus discours'd, <hi>Olympicus</hi> taking him up: There is this farther, said he, O <hi>Patrocleas!</hi> which thou shouldst have taken notice of; for how great an Inconvenience and Absurdity arises besides from these Delays and Procrastinations of Divine Justice? In regard the slowness of its Execution takes away the Belief of Providence. For the Wicked perceiving that Calamity and Revenge does not presently follow at the Heels of every enormous Crime, but a long time after, looking upon their Calamity as a Misfortune, and calling it Chance, not Punishment, are nothing at all thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; troubled indeed they well may be at the dire Accident befallen them, but never repent of the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they have committed. For as in usual Discipline, the Punishment which immediately attends the Fault, and the Stripes and Pinches that pursue the Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46327:91"/> correct and reduce the Party to his Duty; but the Luggings by the Ears, the Bastings and Thumpings which are late and out of time laid on, seem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for some other Reason then to teach or instruct, which puts the Sufferer to Pain, without understanding his Error: In like manner, were the Impieties of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Transgressors and hainous Offenders singly scourg'd and repress'd by immediate Severity, it would bring them at length to a Sense of their Folly, humble them, and strike them with an Aw of the Divine <hi>Being,</hi> whom they find with a watchful Eye beholding the Actions and Passions of Men, and feel to be no dilatory, but a speedy Avenger of Iniquity. Whereas that same remiss and slow-pac'd <hi>Justice,</hi> as <hi>Euripides</hi> describes it, that falls upon the Wicked by Accident, by reason of its incertainty, ill-tim'd Delay, and disorderly Motion, seems rather to resemble Chance then Providence. So that I cannot conceive what Benefit there is in these Grindstones of the Gods, which are said to grind so late, by which Celestial Punishment is obscur'd, and the Aw of evil doing rendred vain and despicable.</p>
               <p>These things thus uttered, and I in a deep Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what he had said, <hi>Timon</hi> interposing, Is it your Pleasure, said he, that I shall put an end to the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of this knotty Question, or shall I first permit him to argue in opposition to what has been propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already? Nay then, said I, to what purpose is it, to let in a third Wave to drown the Argument, if he be not able to repel or avoid the Objections already made?</p>
               <p>To begin therefore, as from the <hi>Vestal Hearth,</hi> from that ancient Circumspection and Reverence which our Ancestors, Academic Philosophers also, bare to the Supream God-head, we shall utterly decline to meddle with that mysterious <hi>Being,</hi> as if we could presume to utter positively any thing concerning it. For though
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46327:92"/> it may be born withal, for Men unskill'd in Musick, to talk at random of Notes and Harmony, or for such as never experienc'd Warfare, to discourse of Arms and Military Affairs; it would be a bold and daring Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in us, that are but mortal Men, to dive too far into the incomprehensible Mysteries of Deities and <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> Just as if Persons void of Knowledge, should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to Judge of the Methods and Reason of cunning Artists by slight Opinions and probable Conjectures of their own. Thus, it is not for one that understands nothing of the Science, to give a Reason why the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician did not let Blood before, but afterwards; or why he did not bath his Patient yesterday, but to day. And so likewise neither is it easie nor safe to speak otherwise of the Supream Deity, then only this, that he alone it is, who knows the most convenient time to apply most proper Corrosives for the Cure of Sin and Impiety, and as Medicaments to administer Punishments to every Transgressor, yet not confin'd to an equal Quality and Measure common to all Distempers, nor to one and the same time. Now that the Physical Knowledge, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Cure and Preservation of the Soul, is the most transcendent of all other Sciences, besides ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other Witnesses, even <hi>Pindar</hi> himself testifies, where he gives to God, the Ruler and Lord of all things, the Title of the most <hi>Perfect Artificer,</hi> as being the grand Author and Distributer of Justice, to whom it properly belongs to determine, at what time, in what manner, and to what degree to punish every particular Offender. And <hi>Plato</hi> asserts, that <hi>Minos</hi> being the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> was the Disciple of his Father, to learn this Science. Intimating thereby, as if it were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any other then a Schollar, bred up in the School of Equity, rightly to behave himself in the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice, or to make a true Judgment of another, whether he does well or no. For the Laws which are
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46327:92"/> constituted by Men, do not always prescribe that which is unquestionably and simply Decent, or of which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is altogether without Exception perspicuous, in regard that some of their Ordinances seem to be on purpose ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously contriv'd. Particularly, what in <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> the <hi>Ephori</hi> ordain at their first entring into the Magistracy, that no Man suffer the Hair of his upper Lip to grow; only that they be obedient to the Laws, to the end they may not seem grievous to them. Thus the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they asserted the Freedom of any one, cast a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Straw upon his Body; and when they make their last Wills and Testaments, some they leave to be their Heirs, while others sell their Estates. Which seems to be altogether contrary to Reason. But that of <hi>Solon</hi> is most absurd, who when a City is up in Arms, and all in Sedition, brands with Infamy, the Person who stands Neuter, and adheres to neither Party. And thus a Man that apprehends not the Reason of the Lawgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or the Cause why such and such things are so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, might number up several Absurdities of many Laws. What Wonder then, since the Actions of Men are so difficult to be understood, if it be no less diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to determine concerning the Gods, wherefore they inflict their Punishments upon Sinners, sometimes later, sometimes, sooner. Nor do I alledge these things as a Pretence to avoid the Dispute, but to secure the Pardon which I beg. To the end that our Discourse, having a Regard, as it were to some Port or Refuge, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the more boldly in producing probable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to clear the Doubt. But first, consider this, that God, according to <hi>Plato,</hi> when he propos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the middle, the Exemplar of all that was good and Holy, indulges Human Vertue, by which, Man is in some measure rendred like himself, to those that are able to follow the Deity by Imitation. For univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Nature being at first void of Order▪ before it came
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46327:93"/> to be form'd into a World, had this Beginning of its Change, from a certain infus'd Similitude of that Idea, and Vertue which is in God. And the self same <hi>Plato</hi> asserts, that Nature first kindled the Sence of Seeing within us, to the end that the Soul, by the Sight and Admiration of the Heav'nly Bodies being accustom'd to love and embrace Decency and Order, might be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to hate the Disorderly Motions of wild and raving Passions, and avoid Levity and Rashness depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chance, as the Original of all Improbity and Vice. For there is no greater Benefit that Men can enjoy from God, then by the Imitation and Pursuit of those Perfections, and that Sanctity which is in him, to be excited to the Study of Vertue. Therefore God with Forbearance and at Leisure, inflicts his Punishment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wicked, not that he is afraid of committing an Error, or of repenting, should he accelerate his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but to eradicate that brutish and eager Desire of Revenge, that reigns in human Breasts, and to teach us that we are not, in the Heat of Fury, nor when our Anger heaving and palpitating, boyls up above our Understanding, to fall upon those who have done us an Injury, like those who seek to gratifie a vehement Thirst or craving Appetite; but that we should in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this mildness and forbearance, with due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of Mind, till after such sufficient time for Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration taken, as may admit of no Repentance, give way to the Desire of Chastisement or Correction. For as <hi>Socrates</hi> observ'd, it is far the lesser Mischief for a Man, distemper'd with Ebriety and Gluttony, to drink Puddle-water, then when the Mind is disturb'd and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharg'd with Anger and Fury, before it be setled and become limpid again, for a Man to seek the Sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ting his Revenge upon the Body of his Friend or Kinsman. For according to the Saying of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> Revenge is not the nearest to Injury, but being at a remote distance
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46327:93"/> from it, observes the most convenient Opportunity. For as Anger, according to that of <hi>Melanthius.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Quite from the Brain transplants the Wit,</l>
                  <l>Vile Acts designing to commit.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So Reason does that which is just and moderate, laying Passion and Fury aside. Whence it comes to pass, that Men giving ear to Humane Examples, become more mansuete and gentle, as <hi>Plato,</hi> who holding his Cudgel over his Pages Shoulders, as himself relates, paus'd a good while, correcting his own Anger. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Archytas,</hi> observing the Sloth and wilful Negligence of his Servants in the Field, and perceiving his Passion to rise at a more then usual rate, did no more, but as he went away, <hi>'Tis your good Fortune,</hi> said he, <hi>that ye have anger'd me.</hi> If then the Sayings of Men, when call'd to mind, and their Actions being read, have such a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to mitigate the Roughness and Vehemency of Wrath, much more becomes it us, beholding God, with whom there is neither Dread or Repentance of any thing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring nevertheless his Punishments to future Time, and admitting Delay, to be cautious and circumspect in in these Matters, and to deem a Divine Part of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that Mildness and long Suffering, of which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us an Example, while by punishing, he reforms some few; by slowly chastizing, helping and Admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many.</p>
               <p>In the second place therefore let us consider this, That Human Punishments of Injuries regard no more then that the Party suffers in his turn, and are satisfi'd that the Offender has suffer'd according to his Merit, and farther they never proceed. Which is the reason that they run after Provocations, like Dogs that bark in their Fury, and immediately pursue the Injury as soon as committed. But probable it is that God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46327:94"/> distemper'd Soul it be, which he prosecutes with his Divine Justice, observes the Motions and Inclinations of it, whether they be such as tend to Repentance, and allows Time for Reformation to those whose Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is neither invincible nor incorrigible. Well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what a Proportion of Vertue, Souls from himself conveyed to Generation, carry along with them, and how strong and vigorous their innate and primitive Good yet continues. For Wickedness buds forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally upon the Corruption of bad Diet and evil Conversation; but then some Souls recovering again to perfect cure, or an indifferent Habitude, this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Deity does not inflict his Punishments alike upon all. But those that are incurable, he presently lops off, and deprives of Life, as being altogether hurtful to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but most baneful to themselves, as always wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in Wickedness. But as for those who probably may be thought to transgress, rather out of Ignorance of what is Vertuous and Good, then through Choice of what is foul and vitious, he grants them time to turn; but if they remain obdurate, then likewise he inflicts his Punishments upon them; for there is no fear least they should escape.</p>
               <p>Now let us consider how oft the Customs and Lives of Men have been chang'd; for which reason the Change of Manners was by the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, signifying <hi>Custom,</hi> as chiefly prevailing in their Change. Therefore I am of Opinion, that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents reported <hi>Cecrops</hi> to have two Bodies, not as some believe, because of a good King he became a merciless and Dragon-like Tyrant, but rather on the contrary, for that being at first both cruel and formidable, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he became a most mild and gentle Prince. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever if this be uncertain, yet we know both <hi>Gelo</hi> and <hi>Hiero</hi> the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and <hi>Pisistratus</hi> the Son of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:46327:94"/> who having obtain'd the Soveraignty by Violence and Wickedness, made a vertuous Use of their Power, and coming unjustly to the Throne, became moderate Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and beneficial to the Public; for by recommending wholsome Laws, and the Exercise of useful Tillage to their Subjects, they reduc'd them from idle Scoffers and talkative Romancers, to be modest Citizens and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous good Husbands. And as for <hi>Gelo,</hi> after he had been succesful in his War, and vanquish'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he refus'd to grant them the Peace which they su'd for, unless they would consent to have it inserted in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that they would surcease from sacrificing their Children to <hi>Saturn.</hi>

Therefore as a Person that is unskilful in Husbandry, would by no means make choice of a piece of Ground thick over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Brakes and Weeds, abounding with wild Beasts, and covered with standing Lakes and Mud; yet to him who hath learnt to understand the Nature of the Earth, these are certain Symptoms of the Softness and Fertility of the Soil; thus great Genius's many times produce many absurd and vile Enormities, of which, we not enduring the rugged and uneasie Vexation, are presently for pruning and lopping off the lawless Transgressors. But the more prudent Judge, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the abounding Goodness and Generosity covertly residing in those transcending Genius's, waits the co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Age and Season for Reason and Vertue to exert it themselves, and gathers the ripe Fruit when Nature has matur'd it. And thus much as to those particulars.</p>
               <p>Now to come to another part of our Discourse, do you not believe that some of the <hi>Greeks</hi> did very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to register that Law in <hi>Eggypt,</hi> among their own, whereby it is enacted, that if a Woman with Child be sentenc'd to dye, she shall be repriev'd till she be deliver'd? All the reason in the World, you'l say. Then, say I, though a Man cannot bring forth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet if he be able, by the Assistance of Time, to reveal any hidden Action or Conspiracy, or to discover some conceal'd Mischief, or to be Author of some wholsome piece of Advice; or suppose that in time, he may produce some necessary and useful Invention, is it not better to delay the Punishment, and expect the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, then hastily to rid him out of the World? It seems so to me, said I; and truly you are in the right, reply'd <hi>Patrocles,</hi> For let us consider: had <hi>Dionysius,</hi> at
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46327:95"/> the beginning of his Tiranny, suffer'd according to his Merits; never would any of the <hi>Greeks</hi> have re-inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sicily,</hi> laid waste by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Nor would the <hi>Greeks</hi> have re-possess'd <hi>Apollonia,</hi> nor <hi>Anactorium,</hi> nor the <hi>Peninsule</hi> of the <hi>Leucadians,</hi> had not <hi>Perianders</hi> Execution been delay'd for a long time: and if I mistake not, it was to the delay of <hi>Cassanders</hi> Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the City of <hi>Thebes</hi> was beholding for her Recovery from Desolation. But the most of those <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who assisted at the Sacrilegious Plunder of that Temple, following <hi>Timoleon</hi> into <hi>Sicily,</hi> after they had vanquish'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and dissolv'd the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Government of that Island, wicked as they were, came all to a wicked End. For assuredly, the Deity makes use of wicked Men, as we make use of Common Executioners to punish the Wickedness of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and then destroys those Instruments of his Wrath; which I believe to be true of most Tyrants. For as the Gall of a <hi>Hyaena,</hi> and the Rennet of a Sea-Calf, and many other filthy Monsters, contain something in them for the Cure of Diseases, thus when some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deserve a sharp and biting Punishment, God subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the implacable Severity of some certain Tyrant, or the cruel Oppression of some Ruler, does not remove either the Torment, or the Trouble, till he has cur'd and purifi'd the distemper'd Nation. Such a sort of Physick was <hi>Phalaris</hi> to the <hi>Agragantines,</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And God expresly foretold the <hi>Sicionyans,</hi> how much their City stood in need of most severe Chastisement, when after they had violently ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd out of the Hands of the <hi>Cleonians, Tiletias,</hi> a young Lad, who had been crown'd at the <hi>Pythian</hi> Games; they tore him Limb from Limb, as their own Fellow Citizen. Therefore <hi>Orthagoras</hi> the Tyrant, and after him, <hi>Myro</hi> and <hi>Cleisthenes</hi> put an end to the Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Lasciviousness of the <hi>Sicyonians;</hi> but the <hi>Cleonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus,</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:46327:96"/> not having the good Fortune to meet with the same Cure, went all to wrack. To this purpose, hear what <hi>Homer</hi> says:
<q>
                     <l>From Parent vile, he far the better Son</l>
                     <l>did spring, whom various Vertues did renown.</l>
                  </q> And yet we do not find that ever the Son of <hi>Cropreus</hi> perform'd any famous or memorable Atchievment; but the Off-spring of <hi>Sisiphus, Autolycus,</hi> and <hi>Phlegyas,</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd among the Number of the most famous and vertuous Princes. <hi>Pericles</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> descended from a wicked Family; and <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great at <hi>Rome,</hi> was the Son of <hi>Strabo,</hi> whose dead Body, the <hi>Roman</hi> People, in the height of their Hatred conceiv'd against him when alive, cast forth into the Street, and trampl'd in the Dirt. Where is the Absurdity then, as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman never cuts away the Thorn till it injures the <hi>Asparagus,</hi> or as the <hi>Libians</hi> never burn the Stalks till they have gather'd all the <hi>Ladanum,</hi> if God never extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates the evil and thorny Root of a Renowned and Royal Race, before he has gather'd from it the mature and proper Fruit? For it would have been a far greater a Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the <hi>Phocenses,</hi> though a thousand more of <hi>Iphitus</hi>'s Horses and Oxen had perish'd, or that they had lost a far greater Sum in Gold and Silver out of their Temple of <hi>Delphos,</hi> then to have miss'd among them the Birth of <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> and <hi>Esculapius,</hi> and those many others, who of wicked and vicious Men, became highly vertuous and beneficial to their Country. I would gladly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not better to inflict deserved Punishment in due season, and at convenient times, then hastily and rashly, when a Man is in the heat and hurry of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Witness the Example of <hi>Callippus,</hi> who, under the Pretence of being his Friend, having stabb'd <hi>Dio,</hi> was himself soon after slain by <hi>Dio</hi>'s Intimates, with the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46327:96"/> same Daggar. Thus again, when <hi>Mitius</hi> of <hi>Argos</hi> was slain in a City Tumult, the Brazen Statue which stood in the Market-place, soon after, at the time of the publick Shews, fell down upon the Murtherers Head and kill'd him. What befel <hi>Bessus</hi> the <hi>Paeonite,</hi> and <hi>Aristo</hi> the <hi>Octaean,</hi> chief Commander of the foreign Souldiers? I suppose you understand full well, <hi>Patrocles.</hi> Not I, by <hi>Jove,</hi> but I desire to know. Well then, I say this <hi>Aristo,</hi> having with Permission of the Tyrants, carry'd away the Jewels and Ornaments belonging to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphyle,</hi> which lay deposited in that City, made a Present of them to his Wife. The Punishment for this was, that the Son being highly incens'd against his Mother, for what reason it matters not, set Fire to his Fathers House and burnt it to the Ground, with all the Family that were in it.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Bessus,</hi> it seems he kill'd his own Father, and the Murther lay conceal'd a long time. At length, being invited to Supper among Strangers, after he had so loosen'd a Swallows Nest with his Spear that it fell down, he kill'd all the young ones. Upon which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by the Guests that were present, what Injury the Swallows had done him, that he should commit such an irregular Act? Did you not hear, said he, these cursed Swallows, how they clamor'd and made a Noise, false Witnesses as they were, that I had long ago kill'd my Father? This Answer strook the rest of the Guests with so much Admiration, that after a due pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon his Words, they made known the whole Story to the King. Upon which, the matter being div'd into, <hi>Bessus</hi> was brought to condign Punishment. These things I have alledg'd, as it was but reason upon a supposition, that there is a forbearance of inflicting punishment upon the Wicked. As for what remains it behoves us to listen to <hi>Hesiod,</hi> where he asserts, not like <hi>Plato,</hi> that the Punishment of Injustice accompanies
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46327:97"/> the Suffering, but that it is of the same Age with it, and arises from the same Place and Root. For, says he,
<q>
                     <l>Bad Counsel, so the Gods ordain,</l>
                     <l>Is most of all the Adviser's Bane.</l>
                  </q> And in another Place,
<q>
                     <l>He that his Neighbours Harm contrives, his Art</l>
                     <l>Contrives the Mischief 'gainst his own false Heart.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported, that the <hi>Cantharides</hi> Fly, by a certain kind of Antipathy, carries within it self, the Cure of the Wound which it inflicts. On the other side Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, at the same time it is committed, engendring its own Vexation and Torment, not at last, but at the very Instant of the Injury offer'd, suffers the Reward of the Injustice it has done. And as every Malefactor bears his own Cross to the Place of his Execution, so are all the various Torments of various wicked Actions, prepar'd by the several sorts of Wickedness themselves. Such a diligent Architectress of a miserable and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life is Wickedness, wherein Shame is still accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd with a thousand Terrors and Commotions of the Mind, incessant Repentance, and never ceasing Tumults of the Spirits. However, there are some People that differ little or nothing from Children, who many times beholding Malefactors upon the Stage, in their gilded Vestments, and short purple Cloaks, dancing with Crowns upon their Heads, admire and look upon 'em as the most happy Persons in the World, till they see 'em goaded and lash'd, and Flames of Fire curling from underneath their sumptuous and gawdy Garments. Thus there are many wicked Men, surrounded with numerous Families, splendid in the Pomp of Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46327:97"/> and Illustrious for the Greatness of their Power, whose Punishments never display themselves till those glorious Persons come to be the publick Spectacles of the People, either slain and lying weltring in their Blood, or or else standing on the top of the Rock, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be tumbl'd headlong down the Precipice; which indeed cannot so well be said to be a Punishment, as the Consummation and Perfection of Punishment. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over as <hi>Herodicus</hi> the <hi>Selimbrian,</hi> falling into a Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the most incurable of all Diseases, was the first who intermix'd the Gymnastic Art with the Science of Physic (as <hi>Plato</hi> relates) on purpose to spin out in length a tedious time of dying, as well for his own, as the Sake of others labouring under the same Distemper. In like manner there are some wicked Men, who flatter themselves to have escap'd the present Punishment, yet not after such a Space, but for a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Tract of Time, endure a more lasting, not a shorter Punishment; not punish'd with Old Age, but growing old under the Tribulation of tormenting Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. When I speak of a long time, I speak in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our selves. For as to the Gods, every distance and distinction of Human Life, is nothing: And <hi>now,</hi> and <hi>not thirty years ago,</hi> is the same thing, as that such a Malefactor was tormented or hang'd in the Morning, and not in the Afternoon. More especially, since a Man is but shut up in this Life, like a close Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in a Goal, from whence it is impossible to make an Escape; and yet we Feast and Banquet, are full of Business, receive Rewards, and enjoy Offices. Though certainly these are but like the Sports of those that play at Dice, or any other Game in the Goal, while the Rope all the while hangs over their Heads. So that what should hinder me from asserting, that neither they who are shut up in Prison, are truly punish'd, till the Executioner has chopt of their Heads? Or that he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46327:98"/> who has drank Hemlock, then walks about and stays till a Heaviness seizes his Limbs, is in any other Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the Extinction of his natural Heat, and the Coagulation of his Blood deprive him of his Senses? That is to say, if we deem the last Moment of the Punishment to be only the Punishment, and omit the Commotions, Terrors, Expectations and Embitterments of Repentance, with which every Malefactor and all wicked Men are teiz'd upon the committing of any heinous Crime. But this is to deny the Fish to be taken that falls into the Net, before we see it boyl'd and cut into Pieces by the Cook. For every Offender is within the Gripes of the Law, so soon as he has committed the Crime; and no sooner has he swallow'd the sweet Bait of Injustice, but he may be truly said to be caught, while his Conscience within, tearing and gnawing upon his Vitals, allows him no Rest:
<q>
                     <l>Like the swift Tuny, frighted from his Prey,</l>
                     <l>Rowling and plunging in the anger'd Sea.</l>
                  </q> For the daring Rashness and precipitat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Boldness of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, continues violent and active till the Fact be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated. But then the Passion, like a surceasing Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, growing slack and weak, surrenders it self to Superstitious Fears and Terrors. So that <hi>Stesicorus</hi> may seem to have compos'd the Dream of <hi>Clytemnestra,</hi> to set forth the Events and Truth of Things:
<q>
                     <l>—Then seem'd a Dragon to draw near,</l>
                     <l>With mattry Blood all on his Head besmear'd;</l>
                     <l>And then the King <hi>Plesthenides</hi> appear'd.</l>
                  </q> For Visions in Dreams, noon-day-Apparitions, Oracles, Descents into Hell, and whatever Objects else which may be thought to be transmitted from Heaven, raise
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46327:98"/> continual Tempests and Horrors in the very Souls of the Guilty. Thus it is reported, that <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> in a Dream, beheld himself flead by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and then boyl'd; and that his Heart speaking to him out of the Kettle, utter'd these Words, <hi>I am the Cause thou suffer'st all this.</hi> And another time, That he saw his Daughters run about him, their Bodies burning and all in a Flame. <hi>Hipparcus</hi> also, the Son of <hi>Pifistratus,</hi> had a Dream, that the Goddess <hi>Venus,</hi> out of a certain Vial, flung Blood in his Face. The Favorites of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> Sirnam'd the <hi>Thunderer,</hi> dreamt that they saw their Master cited to the Judgment-Seat by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> where Wolves and Vultures were his Judges; and then distributing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eat Quantities of Flesh among his Enemies. <hi>Pausanias,</hi> in the heat of his Lust, sent for <hi>Cleonice,</hi> a freeborn Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of <hi>Bizantium,</hi> with an Intention to have enjoy'd her all Night; but when she came, out of a strange sort of Jealousie and Provocation, for which he could give no reason, stabb'd her. This Murther was attended with frightful Visions; insomuch that his Repose in the Night was not only interrupted with the Appearance of her Shape, but still he thought he heard her uttering these Lines;
<q>
                     <l>To Execution go, the Gods are just,</l>
                     <l>And rarely pardon Murther joyn'd with Lust.</l>
                  </q> After this, the Apparition still haunting him, he sail'd to <hi>Psycopompeion</hi> in <hi>Heraclea,</hi> and by Propitiations, Charms and Dirges, call'd up the Ghost of the Damsel. Which appearing before him, told him in few Words, that he should be freed from all his Affrights and Molestations upon his Return to <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi> Where he was no sooner arriv'd, but he died. But notwithstanding all this, if there were nothing that befel the Soul after the Expiration of this Life, but that Death were the end of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46327:99"/> all Reward and Punishment, I might infer from thence, that the Deity was remiss, and indulgent in swiftly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the Wicked, and depriving them of Life. For if a Man shall assert, that space of time no otherwise afflicts the Wicked, but that the Convincement of the Crime is a fruitless and barren thing, that produces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Good, nothing worthy of Amendment from the many great and terrible Combats and Agonies of the Mind, the Consideration of these things altogether subverts the Soul. As it is related of <hi>Lysimacus,</hi> who being under the violent Constraint of a parching Thirst, surrender'd up his Person and his Dominions to the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tae</hi> for a little Drink; but after he had quench'd his Drought, and found himself a Captive, Shame o' this Wickedness of mine, cry'd he, that for so small a Pleasure, have lost so great a Kingdom: But it is a difficult thing for a Man to resist the natural Necessity of mortal Passions. Yet when a Man, either out of Avarice, or Ambition of civil Honour and Power, or to gratifie his Venereal Desires, commits any enormous and hainous Crime, after which the Thirst and Rage of his Passion being allay'd, he comes to set before his Eyes the ignominious and horrible Passions tending to Injustice still remaining, but sees nothing useful, nothing necessary, nothing conduceable to make his Life happy; may it not be probably conjectur'd, that such a Person is frequently sollicited by these Reflexions, to consider, how rashly, either prompted by vain Glory, or for the sake of a Lawless and barren Pleasure, he has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the noblest and greatest Maxims of Justice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, and overflow'd his Life with Shame and Trouble? As <hi>Simononides</hi> jeasting, was wont to say, that he often found a Chest full of Silver, but always empty of true Benefit. Thus wicked Men, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating their own Wickedness, and observing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Pleasure so barren and fruitless, find their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46327:99"/> frustrated, but their Minds distress'd with Fears and Sorrows, ungrateful Remembrances, Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of Futurity, and Distrusts of present Accidents; as we hear <hi>Ino</hi> complaining upon the Theatre, after her Repentance of what she had done.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Dear Women, tell me, with what Face</l>
                  <l>shall I return to dwell with <hi>Athemas?</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>As if it ne're had been my luckless Fate,</l>
                  <l>The worst of foul Misdeeds to perpetrate?</l>
               </q>
               <p>Thus is it not reason to believe, that the Soul of every wicked Man revolves and reasons within it self, which was by burying in oblivion former Transgressions, and casting from it self the Guilt of hitherto committed Crimes, to fit frail Mortality under her Conduct for a new Course of Life. For unless we will allow unjust and impious Persons to be wise and prudent, there is nothing for a Man to conside in, nothing but what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes like Smoak, nothing durable or constant in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Impiety proposes to its Self; but where ever Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, Voluptuousness, inexorable Hatred, Enmity and Improbity associate together; there you shall also be sure to find Superstition nestling and herding with Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy and Terror of Death; a swift Change of the most violent Passions, and an arrogant Ambition after undeserved Honour. Such Men as these stand in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dread of their Contemners and Backbiters, they fear their Applauders, believing themselves injur'd by their Flatteries; and more especially, are at Enmity with bad Men, because they are so free to extol those that seem good. However, that which hardens Men to Mischief, soon cankers, grows brittle, and shivers in pieces like bad Iron. So that in process of time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to understand themselves better, and to be more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of their Miscarriages, they disdain, abhor, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46327:100"/> utterly disclaim their former Course of Life. Not that every wicked Man, who restores a Trust, or becomes Surety for his Friend, or Ambitious of Honour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes more largely to the Benefits of his Country, may be said to be in a Condition of Repentance, or to be sorry for what he has done amiss, by reason of the natural Inclination of the Mind to ramble and change; and therefore some men being clapp'd and humm'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Theatre, presently fall a weeping, their Desire of Glory relapsing into Covetousness. But as for those which sacrific'd the Lives of Men to the Success of their Tyrannies and Conspiracies, as <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> or plunder'd their Friends of their Treasure, and depriv'd them of their Estates, as <hi>Glaucus</hi> the Son of <hi>Epicides,</hi> can we believe such Men did not repent and abhor themselves, or that they were not sorry for the Perpetration of such foul Enormities? For my part, if it may be lawful for me to deliver my Opinion, I believe there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, either for the Gods or Men to inflict their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments upon the most wicked and sacrilegious Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; seeing that the Course of their own Lives is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to chastize their Crimes, while they remain under the Consternations and Torments attending their Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And now consider whether my Discourse have not enlarg'd it self too far. To which, <hi>Timon,</hi> perhaps, said he, it may seem to have been too long, if we consider what remains behind, and the length of time requir'd for the Discussion of our other Doubts. For now I am going about to propose the last Question, in pursuit of the first, which has hitherto, with an indifferent clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness been explain'd. Now as to what we have farther to say, we find that <hi>Euripides</hi> delivers his Mind freely, and censures the Gods for imputing the Transgressions of Fore-fathers upon their Off-spring: And I am apt to believe, that they who are most silent among us, do the like. For if the Offenders themselves
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46327:100"/> have already receiv'd their Reward, then there is no reason why the Innocent should be punish'd, since it is not equal to punish even Criminals twice for the same Fact. But if remiss and careless, the Gods omitting opportunely to inflict their Penalties upon the Wicked, send down their tardy Rigor on the Blameless; they do not well to repair their defective Slowness by Injustice. As it is reported of <hi>Esop,</hi> that he came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time to <hi>Delphos,</hi> having brought along with him a great quantity of Gold, which <hi>Croesus</hi> had bestow'd upon him, on purpose to offer a most magnificent Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Gods, and with a Design moreover to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute among the Priests and People of <hi>Delphos</hi> four <hi>Mina's</hi> apiece. But there happening some disgust and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between him and the <hi>Delphians,</hi> 'tis true, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his Solemnity, but sent back his Money to <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> not deeming those ingrateful People worthy of his Bounty. Upon which the <hi>Delphians</hi> laying their Heads together, accus'd him of Sacriledge, and then threw him down headlong from a steep and prodigious Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, which is there call'd <hi>Hyampeia.</hi> Upon which it is reported, that the Deity being highly incens'd against them for so horrid a Murther, brought a Famine upon the Land, and infested the People with noisom Diseases of all sorts: insomuch that they were constrain'd to make it their Business to travel to all the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies and Places of publick Concourse in <hi>Greece,</hi> making publick Proclamation, where e're they came, that whoever they were that would demand Justice for the Death of <hi>Esop,</hi> they were prepar'd to give him Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and to undergo whatever Penalty he should require. Three Generations afterwards, came one <hi>Id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> a <hi>Samian,</hi> no way of Kin, or otherwise related to <hi>Esop,</hi> but only descended from those who had purchas'd <hi>Esop</hi> in <hi>Samos;</hi> to whom the <hi>Delphians</hi> paying those Forfeitures which he demanded, were deliver'd from all
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46327:101"/> their pressing Calamities. And from hence, by report, it was, that the Punishment of Sacrilegious Persons was translated from the Rock <hi>Hyampeia,</hi> to that other Cliff which bears the Name of <hi>Nauplia.</hi> Neither is <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> applauded by those who have the greatest Esteem for his Memory (of which Number are we our selves) who utterly lay'd wast the City of the <hi>Branchidae,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Men, Women and Children to the Sword, for that their Ancestors had long before deliver'd up the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Miletum.</hi> In like manner, <hi>Agathocles,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> when the <hi>Corcyraeans</hi> requested to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of him, why he depopulated their Island, deriding and scoffing at their Demand, <hi>By</hi> Jove, said he, <hi>for no other reason, but because your Fore-fathers entertain'd</hi> Ulysses. And when the Islanders of <hi>Ithaca</hi> expostulated with him, why his Souldiers carry'd away their Sheep. Because, said he, when your King came to our Island, he put out the Eyes of the Shepherd himself. And therefore do you not think <hi>Apollo</hi> more extravagant then all these, for punishing so severely the <hi>Phedeatae,</hi> by stopping up that profound and spacious Receptacle of all those Floods that now cover their Country, upon a bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that <hi>Hercules,</hi> a thousand years ago, took away the <hi>Prophetic Tripos,</hi> and carry'd it to <hi>Pheneum?</hi> Or when he foretold to the <hi>Sybarites,</hi> that all their Calamities should cease, upon condition they appeas'd the Wrath of <hi>Leucadian Juno,</hi> by enduring three ruinous Calamities upon their Country. Nor is it so long since, that the <hi>Locrians</hi> surceas'd to send their Virgins to <hi>Troy.</hi>

               <p>And all this to gratifie the Lasciviousness of <hi>Ajax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now where is the Reason or Justice of all this? Nor is the Custom of the <hi>Thracians</hi> to be approv'd, who to this day abuse their Wives in revenge of their Cruelty to <hi>Orpheus:</hi> And with as little reason are the <hi>Barbarians</hi> about <hi>Eridanus,</hi> or the River <hi>Po,</hi> to be extoll'd, who once a year put themselves into Mourning for the Misfortune of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eton.</hi> And still more ridiculous then all this, it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be, when all those People that liv'd at the time took no notice of <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s Mischance, that they who happen'd to be born five or ten Generations after, should be so idle, as to take up the Custom of going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Black, and bewailing his Downfall. However, in all these things there is nothing to be observ'd but meer Folly; nothing pernicious, nor any thing dangerous.</p>
               <p>But as for the Anger of the Gods, what reason can be given why their Wrath should stop and conceal it self upon a sudden, after the Fact committed, like some certain Rivers, and when all things seem to be forgot, break forth with so much Fury, as not to be atton'd, but with some remarkable Calamities?</p>
               <p>Upon that, so soon as he had done speaking, not a little afraid, least, if he should begin again, he would run himself into many more and greater Absurdities. Do you believe, Sir, said I, all that you have said to be true? Then he, though all that I have alledg'd may not be true, yet if only some part may be allow'd for Truth, do not you think there is the same Difficulty still remaining in the Question? It may be so, said I. And thus it is with those who labour under a vehement burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for whether cover'd with one Blanket or many, the Heat is still the same, or very little different; yet for Refreshments Sake, it may be convenient sometimes
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46327:102"/> to lighten the Weight of the Cloaths. Yet if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent refuse your Courtesie, let him alone. Yet I must tell ye, the greatest part of these Examples look like Fables and Fiction. Call to mind therefore those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Entertainments of the Gods in mortal Habitations, and that most noble Portion, which the publick Cryers proclaim to be receiv'd as their due, by the Off-spring of <hi>Pindar;</hi> and collect with your self, how majestie and grateful a Mark of Grandeur you look upon that to be. Truly, said he, I judge there's no Man living, who would not be sensible of the Curiosity and Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of such an Honour, displaying Antiquity void of Tincture and false Glitter, after the Greek manner, unless he were such a Brute, that I may use the Words of <hi>Pindar</hi> himself;
<q>
                     <l>Whose cole black Heart from natural Dross unpurg'd,</l>
                     <l>Had only by cold Flames at first been forg'd.</l>
                  </q> Therefore, I forbear, said I, to mention that same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, not much unlike to this, and usually made after the Conclusion of the <hi>Lesbian Ode,</hi> to the Honour, and in Memory of the ancient <hi>Terpander.</hi> But you on the other side, deem your self worthy to be preferr'd above all the rest of the <hi>Booetians,</hi> as being of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Race of the <hi>Opheltiadae,</hi> and among the <hi>Phocaeans,</hi> you claim undoubted Preeminence, for the Sake of your Ancestor <hi>Diaphantus.</hi> And for my part, I must acknowledge that you were one of the first, who assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me as my Second, against the <hi>Lycormaeans</hi> and <hi>Satilae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> claiming the Priviledge and Honour of wearing Crowns, due by the Laws of <hi>Greece</hi> to the <hi>Descendants</hi> from <hi>Hercules;</hi> at what time I affirm'd that those Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Guerdons ought more especially to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd inviolable to the immediate Progeny of <hi>Hercules;</hi> in regard that though he were so great a Benefactor to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46327:102"/> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet in his Life time, he was not thought worthy of any Reward or Return of Gratitude. You recal to my Remembrance, said he, a most noble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and worthy the Debate of Philosophy it self. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, therefore, said I, that vehement Humor of yours, that excites ye to accuse the Gods; nor take it ill, if many times Celestial Punishment discharges it self upon the Off-spring of the Wicked and Vicious. Neither be too much overjoy'd, nor too forward to applaud those Honours which are due to Nobility of Birth. For it becomes us, if we believe that the Reward of Vertue ought to be extended to Posterity, by the same reason to take it for granted, that Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought not to overslip and connive at Impieties committed, but to run forward, and reciprocally pursue the Progeny of the Transgressors, according to the Demerits of their Fore-fathers. And therefore they that with Pleasure behold the Race of <hi>Cimon</hi> highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd in <hi>Athens;</hi> on the other side, they that fret and sume at the Exilement of the Posterity of <hi>Lachares</hi> or <hi>Ariston,</hi> are both too remiss and Oscitant in their Searches after the true Reason of things, or else too morose and overquarrelsome with the Deity it self. One while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing the Divinity, if the Posterity of an unjust and wicked Person seems to prosper in the World; another time, no less moody and finding fault, if it fall out that the Race of the Wicked come to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stroy'd and extirpated from the Earth. And thus whether the Children of the Wicked, or the Children of the Just fall under Affliction, the Case is all one to them, the Gods must suffer alike in their bad Opinions. These, said I, are the Preliminaries, which I would have you make use of against those cholerick Accusers, and testy Snarlers, of whom I have given you warning.</p>
               <p>But now to take in hand once more, as it were the first end of the Bottom of Thread, in this same dark
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46327:103"/> Discourse of the Gods, wherein there are so many Windings and Turnings, and gloomy Labyrinths; let us by degrees, and with caution, direct our Steps to what is most likely and probable. Since even in those things which fall under our dayly Practice and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are many times at a Loss to determine the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and unquestion'd Truth. For Example, what certain Reason can be given for that Custom amongst us, of ordering the Children of Parents that dye of a Consumption, or a Dropsie, to sit with both their Feet soaking in the Water, till the Dead Body be burnt? Only People believe, that thereby the Disease is not only prevented from becoming Hereditary, but that it is a Charm to secure those Children from it as long as they live. Again, what should be the Reason that if a Goat, lighting upon a Piece of <hi>Sea-Holly,</hi> holding it chewing in her Mouth, the whole Heard will stand still till the Goatheard come and take it out? Other hidden Properties there are, which by Vertue of certain incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Touches and Transitions, pass either swifter or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lower from some peculiar Bodies into Others. But we admire the Intervals of Time, and not the Distances of Place. And yet there is more reason to wonder, that <hi>Athens</hi> should be infected with an Epidemic Contagion, taking its Rise in <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> that <hi>Pericles</hi> should dye, and <hi>Thucidides</hi> be smitten with the Infection; then that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Impiety of the <hi>Delphians</hi> and <hi>Sybarites,</hi> delay'd Vengeance should at length overtake their Posterity. For these hidden Powers and Properties have their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Connexions and Correspondences between their utmost Endings, and their first Beginnings; of which, although the Causes be conceal'd from us, yet silently they bring to pass their proper Effects. Not but that there is a Reason ready at hand for the Justice, which pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Punishments showr'd down from Heaven upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cities. For a City is a kind of entire Thing,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46327:103"/> and a continued Body; a certain sort of Creature, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver subject to the Changes and Alterations of Age, nor varying through process of time, from one thing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but sympathizing, and peculiar to its self, and receiving the Punishment or Reward of what ever it has done, or ever acted in common, so long as the Community, which makes it a Body, and binds it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the mutual Bands of Human Benefit, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves its Unity. For he that goes about, of one City to make many, and perhaps an infinite Number, by distinguishing the Intervals of Time, seems to be like a Person who would make several of one single Man, because he is now grown Elderly, who before was a Young Man, and before that a meer Stripling. Or rather, it resembles the Method of Disputing amongst the <hi>Epicharmians,</hi> the first Authors of that Manner of Arguing, call'd the <hi>Increaser.</hi> He that formerly ran in Debt, although he never pay'd it, ows nothing now, as being become another Man. And he that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited Yesterday to Supper, the next Night comes an Unbidden Guest, for that he is quite another Person; and indeed the Distinctions of Ages cause greater Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in every one of us, then commonly they do in Cities. For he that has seen <hi>Athens</hi> may know it again, thirty years after; the present Manners, Motions, Pastimes, serious Studies, their Familiarities and Marks of their Displeasure, little or nothing differing from what formerly they were. But after a long Absence, there's many a Man, who meeting his own Familiar Friend, hardly knows him again, by reason of the great Alteration of his Countenance, and the Change of his Manners, which are so easily subject to the Alterations of Language, Labour and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all manner of Accidents, and Mutation of Laws, that even they who are most usually conversant with him, admire to see the Strangeness and Novelty of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46327:104"/> Change; and yet the Man is reputed still to be the same from his Birth to his Decease. In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner does a City still remain the same; and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we think it but Justice, that a City should as well be obnoxious to the Blame and Reproach of its ancient Inhabitants, as participate the Glory of their former Puissance and Renown; unless our Carelesness be such as not to mind the throwing all things into the <hi>Heraclitian</hi> River, into which, by common Report, it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cast the same thing twice; as having a secret Property to change the Nature of all things thrown into it. Now then, if a City be one entire and continued Body; the same Opinion is to be conceived of a Race of Men, depending upon one and the same Beginning, and carrying along with it a certain Power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Qualities; in regard that what is begotten cannot be thought to be sever'd from what is begot, like a Piece of Workmanship from the Artificer; the one being begotten of the Person, the other framed by the Work-man; whereas that which is engendred is a part of the Original from whence it sprung, whether meriting Honour, or deserving Punishment. So that were it not but that I might be thought to be too spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in a serious Discourse, I would affirm, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> were more unjust to the Statue of <hi>Cassander,</hi> when they caus'd it to be melted down and defac'd, and that the <hi>Syracusans</hi> were more rigorous to the Dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> when they cast it forth of their own Confines, then if they had punish'd their Posterity. For that the Statue did no way partake of the Substance of <hi>Cassander,</hi> and the Soul of <hi>Dionysius</hi> was absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Body deceas'd. Whereas <hi>Nyseus, Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locrates, Antipater, Philip,</hi> and several others, descended from wicked Parents, still retain'd the most principal Part of those who begot them, not lazy and slugishly dormant, but that very Part by which they live, are
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46327:104"/> nourish'd, act and move, and become rational and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Creatures. Neither is there any thing of Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if being the Off-spring of such Parents, they should retain many of their bad Qualities. In short therefore, I affirm, as it is in the Practise of Physick, that what ever is wholesome and profitable, is likewise just; and he would be accounted ridiculous, that should aver it to be an Act of Injustice to Cauterize the Thumb for the Cure of the <hi>Sciatica;</hi> or when the Liver is Impostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, to Scarifie the Belly; or when the Hoofs of Labouring Oxen are over tender, to anoint the Tips of their Horns. In the same manner is he to be laugh'd at, who seeks for any other Justice in the Punishment of Vice, then the Cure and Reformation of the Offender; and is angry to see the Medicine apply'd to some Parts for the Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of others; as when a Chyrurgeon opens a Vein, to give his Patient Ease upon an Inflammation of the Eyes; for such a one seems to look no farther then what he reaches by his Sences; forgetting that a School-master, by Chastizing one, admonishes all the rest of his Schollars; and that a General Condemning only one in ten, reduces all the rest to Obedience. And thus there is not only a Cure and Amendment of one part of the Body by another, but many times the very Soul it self is inclin'd to Vice or Reformation, by the Leudness or Vertue of another. For there is great reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that as the Impression, so the Alteration is the same. But the Soul being agitated by Fancy and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, as it is either Daring and Confident, or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and Mistrustful, becomes better or worse.</p>
               <p>While I was yet speaking, <hi>Olympiacus</hi> interrupting me, You seem, said he, by this Discourse of yours, to infer as if the Soul were Immortal, which is a Supposition of great Consequence. 'Tis very true, said I, nor is it any more then what your selves have granted already; in regard the whole Dispute has tended from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46327:105"/> to this, that the Supream Deity overlooks, and deals to every one of us according to our Deserts. To which the other, Do you then believe, said he, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of Necessity, that if the Deity observes our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and distributes to every one of us according to our Merits, that our Souls should exist, and be altogether incorruptible, or else for a certain time survive the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy after Death? Not so fast, good Sir, said I, But can we think that God so little considers his own Actions, or is such a Waster of his Time in Trifles, if we had nothing of Divine within us, nothing that in the least resembled his Perfection, nothing permanent and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but were only poor Creatures, that according to <hi>Homers</hi> Expression, faded and dropt like wither'd Leaves, and in a short time too; that he should make so great account of us, like Women that bestow their Pains in making little Gardens, no less delightful to them then the Gardens of <hi>Adonis,</hi> in earthen Pans and Pots, as to create us Souls to blossom and flourish only for a Day in a soft and tender Body of Flesh, without any firm and solid Root of Life, and then to be blasted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd in a Moment, upon every slight Occasion? And therefore if you please, not concerning our selves with other Deities, let us go no farther then the God <hi>Apollo,</hi> whom here we call our own; whether he, knowing so well as we pretend he does, that the Souls of the Deceased vanish away like Clouds or Smoak, exhaling from our Bodies like a Vapour, would accept of so many Propitiations for the Dead, or require such Honours to be pay'd, such Veneration to be given to the Deceas'd, as if he did it to delude and couzen his Believers? And therefore, for my part, I will never deny the Propensity of the Soul, till some Body or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they say <hi>Hercules</hi> did of old, shall be so daring as to come and take away the Prophetical <hi>Tripes,</hi> and so quite ruine and destroy the Oracle. Well knowing,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46327:105"/> that even in these our days several Answers have been utter'd by the Delphick Soothsayer, the same in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which was formerly given to <hi>Corax</hi> the <hi>Naxian.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>It sounds prophane Impiety,</l>
                  <l>To teach that Humane Souls e're dye.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Then <hi>Patrocles,</hi> What Oracle was this? who was that same <hi>Corax?</hi> For both the Master it self, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whom you mention, are Strangers to my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. Certainly, said I, that cannot be; only 'twas my Error which occasioned your Ignorance, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing use of the Addition to the Name, instead of the Name it self. For it was <hi>Callondas</hi> who slew <hi>Archilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> in Fight. Who being thereupon ejected by the <hi>Pythian</hi> Priestess, as one who had slain a Person devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the muses, but afterwards, humbling himself in Prayers and Supplications, intermix'd with undeniable Excuses of the Fact, was enjoyn'd by the Oracle to repair to the Habitation of <hi>Tettix,</hi> there to expiate his Crime, by appeasing the Ghost of <hi>Archilochus.</hi> That Place was call'd <hi>Tenarus,</hi> for there it was, as the Report goes, that <hi>Tettix</hi> the <hi>Cretan</hi> coming with a Navy to the Cape of <hi>Tenarus,</hi> landed, built a City not far from <hi>Psyco Pompeius,</hi> and stor'd it with Inhabitants; near to which, there is a peculiar Place devoted and set a part for appeasing the Ghosts of Persons sent out of the World by violent Deaths.</p>
               <p>In like manner, when the <hi>Spartans</hi> were commanded by the Oracle to attone the Ghost of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> they sent for several Exorcisers and Conjurers out of <hi>Italy,</hi> who by Vertue of their Sacrifices, chas'd the Apparition out of the Temple. Therefore, said I, there is one and the same reason to confirm the Providence of God, and the Immortality of the Soul: Neither is it possible
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46327:106"/> to admit the one, if you deny the other. Now then the Soul surviving after the Decease of the Body, the Inference is the stronger, that it partakes of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reward; for during this mortal Life, the Soul is in continual Combat like a Wrestler; but after all those Conflicts are at an end, she then receives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her Merits. But while the Soul is thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by it self, what those Punishments, what the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of past Trangressions, or just and laudable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, is nothing at all to us that are alive; for either they are altogether conceal'd from our Knowledge, or else we give but little Credit to them. But those Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments that reach succeeding Posterity, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous to all that are living at the same time, restrain and curb the Inclinations of many wicked Persons. Now, in regard there is no Punishment more grievous, or that touches more to the Quick, then for a Man to behold his Children born of his Body, suffering for his Crimes; since nothing can more afflict the surviving Soul of a wicked and lawless Criminal, not so much to see his Statues defac'd, and his Memory dishonoured, by reversing the Ensigns of his Dignity; but to look down upon his own Children, his Friends, or nearest Kindred, ruin'd and overwhelm'd with Calamity; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, were the same Person to live again, he would rather choose the Refusal of all <hi>Jupiters</hi> Honours, then to abandon himself a second time to his wonted Injustice and Extravagant Desires.</p>
               <p>And here I could relate a Story which I lately heard, but that I fear, least you should censure it for a Fable. And therefore I deem it much the better way to keep close to what is probable and consentaneous to Reason. By any means, reply'd <hi>Olympicus,</hi> proceed, and gratifie us with your Story also, since it was so kindly offer'd. Thereupon, when the rest of the Company likewise made me the same Request, Permit me, said I, in the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46327:106"/> first place, to pursue the rational Part of my Discourse, and then, according as it shall seem proper and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, if it be a Fable, you shall have it as cheap as I heard it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bio</hi> was of Opinion, that God, in punishing the Children of the Wicked, for the Sins of their Fathers, seems more irregular then a Physician that should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Physick to a Son or a Grand-child, to cure the Distemper of a Father or a Grand-Father. But this Comparison does not run cleverly, since the Amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Similitude agrees only in some things; but in others is altogether defective. For if one Man be cur'd of a Disease by Physick, the same Medicine will not cure another; nor was it ever known that any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son troubl'd with sore Eyes, or labouring under a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, was ever restor'd to perfect Health, by seeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the same Condition anointed or plaister'd. But the Punishments or Executions of Malefactors are done puclickly in the Face of the World, to the end that Justice appearing to be the Effect of Prudence and Reason, some may be restrain'd by the Correction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon others. So that <hi>Bio</hi> never rightly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended where the Comparison answer'd to our Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  </gap> oftentimes it happens, that a Man comes to be haunted with a troublesome, though not incurable Disease, and through Sloath and Intemperance, improves his Distemper, and weak'ns his Body to that Degree, that he occasions his own Death. After this, 'tis true, the Son does not fall sick, only has receiv'd from his Fathers Seed such a Habit of Body as makes him liable to the same Disease: which a good Physitian, or a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Friend, or a skilful Apothecary, or a careful Master observing, confines him to a strict and spare Diet, restrains him from all manner of Superfluity, keeps him from all the Temptations of delicious Fair, Wine and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and making use of wholsom and proper Physick,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46327:107"/> together with convenient Exercise, dissipates and Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates the Original Cause of a Distemper at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before it grow to a Head, and gets a masterless Dominion over the Body. And is it not our usual Practice, thus to admonish those that are born of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seas'd Parents, to take timely Care of themselves, and not to neglect the Malady, but to expel the Original Nourishment of the Inbred Evil, as being then easily moveable, and apt for Expulsion? 'Tis very true, cry'd they. Therefore, said I, we cannot be said to do an absurd thing, but what is absolutely necessary; not that which is ridiculous, but what is altogether useful; while we prescribe to the Epileptick, the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal, and to those that are subject to the Gout; such Exercises, Diet and Remedies that are proper, not so much because they are at that time troubled with the Distemper, but to prevent the Malady. For a Man begotten by an unsane Body, does not therefore deserve Punishment, but rather the Preservation of proper Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick and good Regiment; which if any one call the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Fear or Effeminacy, because the Person is debarr'd his Pleasures, and put to some sort of Pain by Cupping and Blistring, we mind not what he says. If then it be of such Importance to preserve by Physick and other proper Means, the vitiated Off-spring of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Body, foul and corrupted, ought we to suffer the innate and resembling Principles of a wicked Nature, sprouting up, and budding through evil Custom in Youth, and to stay till being diffus'd into all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Mind, they bring forth and ripen the visible and malignant Fruit of a mischievous Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? for such is the Expression of <hi>Pindar.</hi> Or can you otherwise believe, but that in this particular God is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then <hi>Hesiod,</hi> admonishing and exhorting us in this manner?</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:46327:107"/>
                  <l>Nor mind the Pleasures of the Genial Bed,</l>
                  <l>Returning from th' Interment of the Dead:</l>
                  <l>But propagate thy Race, when Heavenly Food,</l>

               </q>
               <p>Intimating thereby, that a Man was never to attempt the Work of Generation, but in the height of a jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and marry Humor, and when he found himself as it were dissolved into jollity; as if from Procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeded the Impressions not only of Vice or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but of Sorrow and Joy, and of all other Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Affections whatever. However, it is not the Work of Human Wisdom, as <hi>Hesiod</hi> supposes, but of Divine Providence, to foresee the Sympathies and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Mens Natures, before the Malignant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their unruly Passions come to exert it self by hurrying their unadvised Youth into a thousand Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous Miscarriages. For though the Cubs of Bears, and Whelps of Wolves and Apes, immediately disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their several inbred Qualities and natural Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without any Disguise or artificial Concealment; Man is nevertheless a Creature more refin'd, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times curb'd by the Shame of transgressing common Customs, universal Opinion, or the Law, conceals the Evil that is within him, and imitates only what is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and honest. So that he may be thought to have altogether cleans'd and rins'd away the Stains and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of his vicious Disposition, and so cunningly for a long time to have kept his natural Corruption, wrapt up under the Covering of Craft and Dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we are scarce sensible of the Fallacy till we feel the Stripes or Sting of his Injustice; believing Men to be only then unjust, when they offer Wrong to our selves; Lascivious when we see them abandoning themselves to their Lusts; and Cowards, when we see
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46327:108"/> them turning their Backs upon the Enemy; just as if any Man should be so idle, as to believe a Scorpion had no Sting until he felt it; or that a Viper had no Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, until it bit him; which is a silly Conceit. For there is no Man that only then became Wicked, when he appear'd to be so. But having the Seeds and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Iniquity within him long before, the Thief then steals when he meets with a fit Opportunity; and the Tyrant violates the Law, when he finds himself surrounded with sufficient Power. But neither is the Nature and Disposition of any Man conceal'd from God, as taking upon him with more Exactness to scrutinize the Soul then Body; nor does he tarry till actual Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or Leudness be committed, to punish the Hands of the Wrong-doer, the Tongue of the Prophane, or the transgressing Members of the Lascivious and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene. For he does not exercise his Vengeance on the Unjust, for any Wrong that He has receiv'd by his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice: nor is he angry with the High-way Robber, for any Violence done to himself; nor does he abominate the Adulterer, for defiling his Bed. But many times, by way of Cure and Reformation chastizes the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, the Covetous Miser, and the Wronger of his Neighbour, as Physicians endeavour to subdue an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsie, by preventing the coming of the Fits.</p>
               <p>What shall I say? But even a little before we were offended at the Gods protracting and delaying the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of the Wicked; and now we are as much displeas'd, that they do not curb and chastize the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravities of an evil Disposition before the Fact commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Not considering that many times a Mischief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd for future Execution, may prove more dreadful then a Fact already committed; and dormant Villany may be more dangerous then open and apparent Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Nor being able to apprehend the Reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is much safer to bear with the unjust Actions of some Men, then to prevent the Meditating and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46327:108"/> of Mischief in others. As in truth, we do not rightly comprehend, why some Remedies and Physical Druggs are no way convenient for those that labour under a real Disease, yet wholsome and profitable for those that are seemingly in Health, but yet perhaps in a worse Condition then they who are Sick. Whence it comes to pass, that the Gods do not always turn the Transgressions of Parents upon their Children; but if a vertuous Son happen to be the Off-spring of a Wicked Father, as often it falls out that a Sane Child is born of one that is unsound and crazie, such a one is exempted from the Punishment which threatens the whole Descent, as one begot in Sin, as it is barely a Quality. But for a young Man that treads in the Footsteps of a Criminal Race, it is but just, that as Heir to his Fathers Estate, he should succeed to the Punishment of his Ancestors Iniquity. For neither was <hi>Antigonus</hi> punish'd for the Crimes of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> nor <hi>Phyleus</hi> for the Transgressions of <hi>Augeas;</hi> nor <hi>Nestor</hi> for the Impiety of <hi>Neleus,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that though their Parents were wicked, yet they were vertuous themselves. But as for those whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has embrac'd and espous'd the Vices of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, them holy Vengeance prosecutes, pursuing the Likeness and Resemblance of Sin. For as the Warts and Moles, and Freckles of Parents not seen upon the Children of their own begetting, many times after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appear again upon the Children of their Sons and Daughters; and as the <hi>Grecian</hi> Woman that brought forth a Blackamore Infant, for which she was accus'd of Adultery, prov'd her self, upon diligent enquiry, to be the Off-spring of an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> after four Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and as among the Children of <hi>Pytho,</hi> the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibian,</hi> said to be descended from the <hi>Spartans,</hi> that were the Progeny of those Men that sprung from the Teeth of <hi>Cadmus</hi>'s Dragon, the youngest of his Sons, who lately dy'd, was born with the Print of a Spear upon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46327:109"/> his Body, the usual Mark of that ancient Line, which not having been seen for many Revolutions of Years before, started up again, as it were out of the Deep, and shew'd it self the renew'd Testimonial of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Race; so many times it happens, that the first Descents and eldest Races hide and drown the Passions and Affections of the Mind peculiar to the Family, which afterward bud forth again, and desplay the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Propensity of the succeeding Progeny to Vice or Vertue. Having thus concluded, I held my Peace, at what time <hi>Olympiacus</hi> smiling. We forbear, as yet said he, to give you our Approbation, that we may not seem to have forgot the Fable; not but that we believe your Discourse to have been sufficiently made out by Demonstration, only we reserve our Opinion till we shall have heard the Relation of that likewise. Upon which I began again after this manner: There was one <hi>Soleus</hi> a <hi>Thespesian,</hi> the Friend and familiar Acquaintance of that <hi>Protogenes,</hi> who for some time convers'd among us. This Gentleman in his Youth leading a debauch'd and intemperate Life, in a short time spent his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and then for some years became very Wicked; but afterwards repenting his former Follies and Extravagancies, and pursuing the Recovery of his lost Estate, by all manner of Tricks and Shifts, did as is usual with dissolute and lascivious Youth, who when they have Wives of their own, never mind them at all; but when they have dismiss'd them, and find them married to others that watch them with a more vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Affection, endeavour to corrupt and vitiate them by all the unjust and wicked Provocations imaginable. In this Humour, abstaining from nothing that was leud and illegal, so it tended to his Gain and Profit; he got no great matter of Wealth, but procur'd to himself a World of Infamy by his unjust and Knavish Dealing with all sorts of People. Yet nothing made him more
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:46327:109"/> the Talk of Country, then the Answer which was brought him back from the Oracle of <hi>Amphilochus.</hi> For thither it seems he sent to enquire of the Deity, whether he should live any better the remaining part of his Life. To which the Oracle return'd, that it would be better with him after he was dead. And indeed, not long after, in some measure it so fell out; for that happenning to fall from a certain Precipice upon his Neck, though he receiv'd no Wound, nor broke any Limb, yet the Force of the Fall beat the Breath out of his Body. Three Days after, being carry'd forth to be bury'd, as they were just ready to let him down into the Grave, of a sudden he came to himself, and recovering his Strength, so alter'd the whole Course of his Life, that it was almost incredible to all that knew him. For by the Report of the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> there never was in that Age a juster Person in common Dealings between Man and Man, more Devout and Religious, as to Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, more an Enemy to the Wicked, nor more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and faithful to his Friends; which was the reason that they who were most conversant with him, were desirous to hear from himself the Cause of so great an Alteration, not believing that so great a Reformation could proceed from bare Chance; though it were true that it did so, as he himself related to <hi>Protogenes</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his choicest Friends. For when his Sence first left his Body, it seem'd to him as if he had been some Pilot flung from the Helm by the force of a Storm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the midst of the Sea. Afterwards, rising up again above Water by degrees, so soon as he thought he had fully recover'd his Breath, he lookt about him every way, as if one Eye of his Soul had been open. But he beheld nothing of those things which he was wont for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to see, only he saw Stars of a vast Magnitude, at an immense distance one from the other, and sending forth a Light most wonderful for the brightness of its
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46327:110"/> Colour, which shot it self out in length with an incredible force: on which the Soul riding, as it were in a Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, was most swiftly, yet as gently and smoothly dandl'd from one place to another. But omitting the greatest part of the Sights which he beheld, he saw, as he said, the Souls of such as were newly departed, as they mounted from below, resembling little fiery Bubbles, to which the Air gave way. Which Bubbles after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards breaking insensibly, and by degrees, the Souls came forth in the Shapes of Men and Women, light and nimble, as being discharg'd of all their Earthly Substance. However, they differ'd in their Motion, for some of them leap'd forth with a wonderful Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and mounted up in a direct Line. Others like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Spindles of Spinning-Wheels turn'd round and round; sometimes whisking upward, sometimes darting down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with a confus'd and mix'd Agitation, that in a very long time, and then hardly could be stopp'd.</p>
               <p>The most part of these Souls he knew not who they were, only perceiving two or three of his Acquaintance, he endeavour'd to have approach'd and discours'd them. But they neither heard him speak, neither indeed did they seem to be in their right Senses, but in a deep Consternation, avoiding either to be seen or felt; they frisk'd up and down at first alone and apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, till meeting at length with others in the same Condition, they clung together; but still their Motions were with the same giddiness and uncertainty as before, without any steerage of Discretion, or purpose of tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any whither: yet sending forth inarticulate Sounds like the Cries of Souldiers in Combat, intermix'd with the doleful Yels of Fear and Lamentation. Others there were that towr'd aloft in the upper Region of the Air, and these lookt gay and pleasant, and kindly and familiarly accosted each other with a more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shew of Civility and Respect. Nevertheless they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46327:110"/> seem'd to shew a kind of Discontent when they were crouded and huddl'd together, but to rejoyce, and were well pleas'd when expanded and at Liberty. One of these, said he, being the Soul of a certain Kinsman, which because the Person dy'd when he was but very young, he did not very well know, drew near him, and saluted him by the Name of <hi>Thespesius;</hi> at which, being in a kind of Amazment, and saying, his Name was not <hi>Thespesius,</hi> but <hi>Aridaeus;</hi> the Spirit reply'd, 'twas true, that formerly he was so call'd, but that from thenceforth he must be <hi>Thespesius,</hi> that is to say, Divine. For thou art not in the Number of the Dead as yet, but by a certain Destiny and Permission of the Gods, thou art come hither only with thy intellectual Faculty, having left the rest of thy Soul, like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, in thy Body. And that thou may'st be assur'd of this, observe it for a certain Rule, both now and hereafter, that the Souls of the Deceas'd neither cast any Shadow, neither do they open and shut their Eye-lids. <hi>Thespesius</hi> having heard this Discourse, was so much the more encourag'd to make use of his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and therefore looking round about to prove the Truth of what had been told him, he could perceive that there follow'd him a kind of obscure and Shadow-like Line, whereas those other Souls shone like a round Body of perfect Light, and were transparent within; and yet there was a very great difference between them too; for that some yielded a smooth, even and contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lustre, all of one Colour, like the Full-moon in her brightest Splendor. Others were mark'd with long Scales, or slender Streaks, distinguishing the Spaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween. Others were all over spotted and very ugly to look upon, as being cover'd with black Speckles like the Skins of Vipers.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this Kinsman of <hi>Thespesius</hi> (for nothing hinders but that we may call the Souls by the Names of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46327:111"/> the Persons which they enliven'd) proceeding to give a Relation of several other things, inform'd his Friend, How that <hi>Adrastia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, was seated in the highest Place of all, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all manner of Crimes and Enormities, and that in the whole Number of the Wicked and Ungodly, there never was any one, whither Great or Little, High or Low, Rich or Poor, that ever could by Force or Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, escape the severe Lashes of her Rigour. But as there are three sorts of Punishments, so there are three several Furies, or Female Ministers of Justice, and to every one of these belongs a peculiar Office and Degree of Punishment. The first of these was call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Pain;</hi> whose Executions are swift and speedy upon those that are presently to receive Bodily Punishment in this Life, and which she manages after a more gentle manner, omitting the Correction of slight Offences, which need but little Expiation. But if the Cure of Impiety require a greater Labour, the Deity delivers those, after Death, to <hi>Dice</hi> or <hi>Revenge.</hi> But when <hi>Dice</hi> has given them over as altogether incurable, then the third and most severe of all <hi>Adrastia</hi>'s Ministers, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinnys</hi> takes them in hand, and after she has chas'd and cours'd them from one place to another flying, yet not knowing where to fly for Shelter or Relief, plagu'd and tormented with a thousand Miseries, she plunges them headlong into an invisible Abyss, the Hideousness of which no Tongue can express.</p>
               <p>Now of all these three sorts of Punishments, that which is inflicted by <hi>Poena</hi> in this Life, resembles the Practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> For as among the <hi>Persians,</hi> they take off the Garments and Turbants of those that are to be punish'd, and tear and whip them before the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders Faces, while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Criminals, with Tears and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, beseech the Executioners to give over, so Corporeal Punishments and Penalties by Mulcts and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46327:111"/> Fines, have not that sharpness of Severity, nor do they reach the Deserts of the Vice, but are accounted great or excessive, according to Opinion, and a Sence of the Pain or Detriment which the Offendor feels. But if any one comes hither, that has escap'd Punishment while he liv'd upon Earth, and before he was well purg'd from his Crimes, <hi>Dice</hi> takes him to task, naked as he is, with his Soul display'd, as having nothing to conceal or vail his Impiety; but on all sides, and to all Mens Eyes, and every way expos'd, she shews him first to his honest Parents, if he had any such, to let them see how degenerate he was, and unworthy of his Progenitors. But if they were wicked likewise, then are their Sufferings rendred yet more terrible by the mutual Sight of each others Miseries, and those for a long time inflicted, till the remorsless Fury has quite defac'd each individual Crime with Pains and Torments, as far surmounting in Sharpness and Severity all Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Tortures of the Flesh, as what is real and evident surpasses an idle Dream. But the Wheals and Stripes that remain after Punishment, appear more sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in some, in others are less evident. View there, said he, those various Colours of Souls. That same black and sordid Hue, is the Tincture of Avarice and Fraud. That bloody and flame-like Dye, betokens Cruelty, and an imbitter'd desire of Revenge. Where you perceive a blewish Colour, 'tis a sign that Soul will hardly be cleans'd from the Impurities of Lascivious Pleasure and Voluptuousness. Lastly, that same dark violet and venomous Colour, resembling the sordid Ink which the Cuttle Fish spews up, proceeds from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. For as during Life, the Wickedness of the Soul being govern'd by Human Passions, and governing the Body, occasions this variety of Colours, so here they are the end of Expiation and Punishment. For these being cleans'd away, the Soul recovers her Native
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46327:112"/> Lustre, and becomes clear and spotless. But so long as these remain, there will be some certain Returns of the Passions, accompany'd with little Pantings and Beatings, as it were of the Pulse; in some remiss and languid, and quickly extinguish'd; in others more quick and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, which being thoroughly chastiz'd, recover a due Habit and Disposition. But the other, by the force of Ignorance, and the enticeing shew of Pleasure, are carry'd into the Bodies of Brute Beasts. For the Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of their Ratiocination, while their Sloathfulness will not permit them to contemplate, hurries them to the active part of Generation; on the other side, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Instrument of Intemperance, yet desirous to gratifie their Desires with the full Swinge of Enjoyment, they endeavour to promote their Design by means of the Body. But alas, here is nothing but an imperfect Shadow and Dream of Pleasure, that never attains to Ability of performance.</p>
               <p>Having thus said, the Spirit carry'd <hi>Thespesius</hi> to a certain place, as it appear'd to him, prodigiously spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; yet so gently, and without the lest Deviation, that he seem'd to be born upon the Rays of the Light, as if he had sate upon the Wings of an Eagle. Thus at length he came to a certain gaping Chawn, that was fadomless downward, where he found himself deserted by that extraordinary Force which brought him thither, and perceiv'd other Souls also to be there in the same Condition. For hovering upon the Wing in Flocks together like Birds, they kept flying round and round the yawning Rift, but durst not enter into it. Now this same Cleft within side, resembl'd the Dens of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> fring'd about with the pleasing Verdure of various Herbs and Plants, that yielded a more delightful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect still of all sorts of Flowers, enamelling the Green so with a wonderful diversity of Colours, and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth at the same time, a soft and gentle Breeze,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46327:112"/> which perfum'd all the Ambient Air with Odors most surprizing, and more grateful to the Smell then the sweet Flavour of Wine to those that Love it. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that the Souls banqueting upon these Fragrancies, were almost all dissolv'd in Raptures of Mirth and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses one among another, there being nothing to be heard for some fair distance round about the place, but Jollity and Laughter, and all the chearful Sounds of Joy and Harmony, which are usual among People that pass their Time in Sport and Merriment.</p>
               <p>The Spirit said moreover, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> ascended through this Overture to Heaven, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning fetch'd up <hi>Semele</hi> the same way; and that it was call'd the <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Oblivion.</hi> Wherefore his Kinsman would not suffer <hi>Thespesius</hi> to tarry there any longer, though very unwilling to depart, but took him away by force; informing and instructing him withal, how strangely, yet how suddenly the Mind was subject to be softned and melted by Pleasure; that the Irrational and Corporeal Part being water'd and incarnated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, revives the Memory of the Body, and that from that Remembrance proceeds Concupiscence and Desire, exciting an Appetite to Generation, which is therefore call'd a violent Propensity bearing down the Soul by the Weight of its Moisture.</p>
               <p>At length, after he had been carry'd as far another way, as when he was transported to the yawning Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he thought he beheld a prodigious standing Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, into which several Rivers discharg'd themselves. Among which there was one whiter then Snow, or the Foam of the Sea; another resembled the Purple Colour of the Rain-bow. The Tinctures of the rest were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; besides that, they had their several Lustres at a distance. But when he drew nearer, and that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air became more subtil and rarify'd, and that the Colours vanish'd, the Goblet retain'd no more of its
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46327:113"/> flourishing Beauty, except the White. At the same time he saw three <hi>Demons</hi> sitting together in a Triangular Aspect, and blending and mixing the Rivers together with certain Measures. Thus far, said the Guide of <hi>Thespesius</hi>'s Soul, did <hi>Orpheus</hi> come, when he sought after the Soul of his Wife, and not well remembring what he had seen, upon his return, rais'd a false Report in the World, That the Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi> was in common, as well to <hi>Night</hi> as to <hi>Apollo;</hi> whereas <hi>Apollo</hi> never had any thing in common with <hi>Night.</hi> But said the Spirit, This Oracle is in common to <hi>Night</hi> and to the <hi>Moon,</hi> no way included within earthly Bounds, nor having any fix'd or certain Seat, but always wandring among Men in Dreams and Visions. For from hence it is that all Dreams are dispiers'd, compounded as they are, after Truth has been jumbl'd with Falshood, and Sincerity with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mixtures of Craft and Delusion. But as for the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> said the Spirit, you neither do see it, neither can you behold it. For the earthy part of the Soul is not capable to release or let it self loose; nor is it permitted to reach Sublimity, but swags downward, as being fasten'd to the Body. And with that, leading <hi>Thespesius</hi> nearer, the Spirit endeavour'd to shew him the Light of the <hi>Tripos,</hi> which, as he said, shooting through the Bosom of <hi>Themis,</hi> fell upon <hi>Parnassus;</hi> which <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pesius</hi> was desirous to see, but could not, in regard the extraordinary Brightness of the Light dazl'd his Eyes; only passing by, he heard the shrill Voice of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, speaking in Verse and Measure, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, as he thought, foretelling the time of his Death. This the Genius told him was the Voice of a <hi>Sybil,</hi> that being orbicularly whirl'd about in the Face of the Moon, continually sang of future Events. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being desirous to have heard more, he was toss'd the quite contrary way, by the violent Motion of the Moon, as by the force of the Waves, so that he could
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46327:113"/> hear but very little, and that very concisely too. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, he learnt something concerning the Mountain <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> and the Burning of <hi>Dicaearchia,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by a casual Fire; together with a piece of a Verse concerning a certain Emperor or great famous Chieftain of that Age.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Who though so just, that no Man could accuse,</l>
                  <l>Howe're his Empire should by Sickness loose.</l>
               </q>
               <p>After this, they pass'd on to behold the Torments of those that were punish'd. And indeed at first they met with none but lamentable and dismal Sights. For <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pesius,</hi> when he least expected any such thing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was aware, was got among his Kindred, his Acquaintance and Companions, who groaning under the horrid Pains of their cruel and ignominious Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with mournful Cries and Lamentations, call'd him by his Name. At length he saw his Father ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a certain Abyss, all full of Stripes, Gashes and Scars; who stretching forth his Hands, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep Silence, but constrain'd to confess by the Scourges of his Torments, acknowledg'd that he had most impiously poyson'd several of his Guests for the Sake of their Gold; of which, not being detected while he liv'd upon Earth, but being convicted after his decease, he had endur'd part of his Torments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that now they were haling him where he should suffer more. However, he durst not either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat or intercede for his Father, such was his Fear and Consternation; and therefore being desirous to retire, and be gon, he look'd about for his kind and courteous Guide; but he had quite left him, so that he saw him no more. Nevertheless, being push'd forward by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deform'd and grim-look'd Goblins, as if there had been some necessity for him to pass forward, he saw
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46327:114"/> how that the Shadows of such as had been notorious Malefactors, and had been punished in this World, were not so grievously tormented, nor alike to others, in regard that only the imperfect and irrational part of the Soul, and which was consequently most subject to Passions, was that which made them so industrious in Vice. Whereas they who had shrouded a vicious and impious Life, under the outward Profession, and a gain'd Opinion of Vertue, those their Tormentors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to turn their Insides outward, and with great Difficulty and dreadful Pain, to writhe and screw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves contrary to the Course of Nature, like the Sea Scolopenders, which having swallow'd the Bait, throw forth their Bowels and lick it out again. Others they flead and scarify'd, to display their occult Hypocrisies and latent Impieties, which were grounded, and had corrupted the principal Part of their Souls. Other Souls, as he said, he also saw, which being twisted two and two, three and three, or more together, gnaw'd and devour'd each other, either upon the Score of old Grudges and former Malice which they had born one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or else in Revenge of the Injuries and Losses they had sustain'd from such or such of their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon Earth. Moreover, he said, that there were certain Lakes that ran parallel and equidistant one from the other, the one of boyling Gold, another of Lead, exceeding Cold, and a third of Iron, which was very scaly and rugged. By the sides of these Lakes stood certain <hi>Demons,</hi> that with their Instruments, like Smiths or Founders, put in or drew out the Souls of such as had transgressed, either through Avarice, or an eager Desire of other Mens Goods. For the Flame of the Golden Furnace having render'd these Souls of a fiery and transparent Colour, they plung'd them into that of Lead, where after they were congeal'd and harden'd into a Substance like Hail, they were then thrown into
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46327:114"/> the Lake of Iron, where they became black and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and being broken and crumbl'd by the Roughness of the Iron, chang'd their Form, and being thus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, they were again thrown into the Lake of Gold; in all these Transmutations, enduring most dreadful and horrid Torments. But they that suffer'd the most dire and dismal Torture of all, were those who thinking that Divine Vengeance had no more to say to them, were again seiz'd and dragg'd to repeated Execution; and these were such, as for whose Trasgressions their Children or Posterity had suffer'd. For when any of the Souls of those Children come hither and meet with any of their Parents or Ancestors, they fall into a Passion, exclaim against them, and shew them the Marks of what they have endur'd. On the other side, the Souls of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents endeavour to sneak out of sight and hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but the others follow them so close at the Heels, and lade them in such a manner with bitter Taunts and Reproaches, that not being able to escape, their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors presently lay hold of them, and hawl them to new Tortures, howling and yelling at the very thought of what they have suffer'd already. And some of these Souls of suffering Posterity, he said, there were, that swarm'd and clung together like Bees or Batts, and in that Posture murmur'd forth their angry Complaints of the Miseries and Calamities which they had endur'd for their Sakes. The last thing that he saw, were the Souls of such, as being design'd for a second Life, were bow'd, bent, and transform'd into all sorts of Creatures by the force of Tools and Anvils, and the Strength of Work-men appointed for that Purpose, that lay'd on without Mercy, bruising the whole Limbs of some, breaking others, disjoynting others, and pounding some to Powder and Annihilation, on purpose to render them fit for other Lives and Manners. Among the rest, he saw the Soul of <hi>Nero,</hi> many ways most grievously tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46327:115"/> but more especially transfix'd with Iron Nails. This Soul the Work-men took in hand, but when they had forg'd it into the Form of one of <hi>Pindars Vipers,</hi> which eats his Way to Life through the Bowels of the Female, of a sudden, a conspicuous Light shone out, and a Voice was heard out of the Light, which gave order for the Transfiguring it again into the Shape of some more mild and gentle Creature, and so they made it to resemble one of those Creatures that usually Sing and Croak about the sides of Ponds and Marshes. For indeed he had in some measure been punish'd for the Crimes he had committed; besides that, there was some Compassion due to him from the Gods, for that he had restor'd the <hi>Grecians</hi> to their Liberty, a Nation the most Noble, and best belov'd of the Gods among all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And now being about to return, such a terrible Dread surpriz'd <hi>Thespesius,</hi> as had almost frighted him out of his Wits. For a certain Woman, admirable for her Form and Stature, laying hold of his Arm, Come hither, said she, that thou may'st the better be Enabl'd to retain the Remembrance of what thou hast seen. With that she was about to have struck him with a small fiery Wand, not much unlike to those that Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters use; but another Woman prevented her. After this, as he thought himself, he was whirl'd or hurry'd away with a strong and violent Wind, forc'd as it were through a Pipe, and so lighting again into his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he began to look about him, as one that was hardly out of his Grave.</p>

               <byline>Translated from the <hi>Greek</hi> by <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> M. L.</byline>
               <p>AS Appeals to Foreign Judicatures first came in request among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> out of their Distrust of one another's Justice, they deeming it as requisite to fetch Justice from abroad, as any other necessary Commodity, which was not of their own Growth: Even so Philosophers, by reason of Dissensions amongst themselves, have in the Decision of some Questions, appealed to the Nature of irrational Beings, as to a strange City, and have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the final Determination of such Questions to the Affections and Dispositions of Brutes, as being unbiassed and not corrupted by Bribes. And this is the general Complaint of Human Frailty, that while we differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the most necessary, and the greatest Things, we consult Horses, Dogs and Birds, how we should marry, beget Children, and bring them up; and, as if the Evidence of Nature in our selves were not to be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we appeal to the Disposition and Affections of brute Beasts, and testifie against the manifold Transgressions
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46327:116"/> of our own Lives, intimating how at the very first, and in the first things we are confounded and disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For Nature conserves the Propriety in them pure, unmixt and simple; but in Men, the Mixture of asci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Opinions and Judgments (as Oyl is serv'd by the Druggists) alters the Proprieties, and does not preserve what is their Peculiar. Nor need we wonder, if irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Animals follow Nature more than Rational; for Plants do it more than Animals, they having neither Imagination nor Passion to avert their Appetite fixt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature, but are bound in Chains, and ever go that one way that Nature leads them. Brutes do little regard Gentleness, Wit or Liberty, they have indeed the Use of irrational Incitements and Appetites, which put them upon wandring and running about, but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom far, for they seem to lye at the Anchor of Nature. As a Rider guides his Ass in the right way by Bit and Bridle, so Reason, the Lord and Master in Man, finds sometimes one turning, sometimes another, but in all its Wandrings leaves no Mark or Footstep of Nature. But in Brutes, observe how all things are accommodated to Nature. As to Marriages, they tarry not till Laws are passed against Celibacy and late Marriages, as <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi>'s Citizens did; they matter not the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of wanting Children, nor are ambitious of the Honour of having three Children, as many Romans marry, and get Children, not that they may have Heirs, but that they may get Estates. Again, the Male accompanies with the Female not at all times, because not Pleasure, but Procreation is his end. Therefore in the Spring time, when the fruitful Breezes blow, and the Air is of a pregnant Temper, then the Female ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the Male, gentle and desirable, wantoning in the sweet Smell and peculiar Ornament of her Body, full of Dew and pure Grass; and when she perceives she has conceived, she modestly departs, and provides
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46327:116"/> for her bringing forth, and for the Safety of what she shall bring forth. What Brutes do, cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently exprest; in all of them, their Affection to their Young is evident by their Providence, Patience and Continence. Indeed we call the Bee wise, and we ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate <hi>the Yellow Honey-maker,</hi> flattering her for glutting us with her Sweetness; but the Wisdom and Art of other Creatures, about their bringing forth, and the rearing their Young, we wholly neglect. For instance, first, the Kings-Fisher, when she has conceived, makes her Nest of the Prickles of the Sea-needle, weaving them one among another, in form of a long Fishing-Net, very thick and uniform; then she puts it under the Dashing of the Waters, that being by degrees bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon and milled, it may acquire a smooth Surface, and it becomes so solid, that it cannot easily be divided by either Stone or Iron. And what is more wonderful, the Mouth of the Nest is so exactly fitted to the Kings-Fisher, that neither a greater nor a less Animal can live in it; for when she is in (as they say) it will not admit the Sea-water. Some sorts of Cats also, when they have brought forth their Young, let them go abroad to Feed, and then take them into their Bellies again, when they go to sleep. The Bear, a most fierce and ugly Beast, brings forth her Young shapeless and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Limbs, but with her Tongue, as with a Tool, she shapes the Members, so that she seems not only to bring forth, but to work out her Young. And does not <hi>Homer</hi>'s Lioness.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Who,</l>
                  <l>When leading of her Whelps, she's met i'th' Wood</l>
                  <l>By Huntsmen, first with Scorn she them descries,</l>
                  <l>Then down drops Courage, and she hides her Eyes.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:46327:117"/>
               <p>Do's she not, I say, look as if she were contriving how to make a Bargain with the Huntsman for her Whelp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? For generally the Love of their Young makes bold Creatures timorous, the Slothful industrious, and the Voracious parcimonious. So <hi>Homer</hi>'s Bird <hi>Gives to her Young, though with her self 't go hard.</hi> She feeds them by starving her self, and when she has taken up her Food, she lays it down again, and keeps it down with her Bill, lest she should swallow it unawares.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>For tender Whelps, when Stranger comes in sight,</l>
                  <l>The harking Bitch prepares her self to fight.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And fear for her young turns into a Second Passion. When Partridges and their Young are pursued, the Old suffer the Young to fly away before, so contriving that the Fowler may think to catch them; thus they hover about, run forward a little, then return again, and so detain the Fowler, till their Young are safe. We dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold Hens, how they cherish their Chickens, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some of them under their spread Wings, suffering others of them to run upon their Backs, and taking them in again, with a Voice expressing Kindness and Joy. When themselves are concern'd, they fly from Dogs and Serpents, but to defend their Chickens, they will venture beyond their Strength, and fight. And shall we think that Nature has bred such Affections in these Creatures, as if she were sollicitous for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Hens, Dogs and Bears, and that she would not by these means make us ashamed? Certainly we must conclude that these Creatures following the Duct of Nature, are for our Example, and they must upbraid the Remorslesness of Humanity, of which Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone is culpable, it not being capable of gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Love, nor knowing how to be a Friend without Profit. Well therefore might the Comedian be admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46327:117"/> who said, <hi>For Reward only Man loves Man. Epicurus</hi> thinks that after this manner Children are beloved of their Parents, and Parents of their Children. But if the Benefit of Speech were allowed to Brutes, and if Horses, Cows, Dogs and Birds were brought upon the Stage, the Song would be chang'd, and it would be said, that neither the Bitch loved her Whelps for Gain, nor the Mare her Foal, nor Fowls their Chickens; but that they were all beloved <hi>Gratis,</hi> and by impulse of Nature: By the Affections of all Brutes, this Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be approved as just and true. And is it not a shame, that the Procreation of Beasts, their Birth, Pains in Birth, and their Education should be by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Gratis;</hi> and that for these very things Man should require Usury, Rewards and Bribes? This Assertion can never be true, nor ought it to be believed. For as in wild Plants, such as wild Vines, Figs and Olives, Nature has implanted the Principles of cultivated Fruit, though crude and imperfect; so she has endowed Beasts with a Love of their Young, though imperfect and not attaining to Justice, nor proceeding further than Utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But in Man, whom she produced a rational and political Being, inclining him to Justice, Law, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Building of Cities, and Friendship; she hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Seeds of these things generous, fair and fruitful, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Love of their Children, following the first Principles, which entred the Constitution of Bodies. For Terms and Expressions are wanting to declare with what Industry Nature, who is skilful, unerring, and not to be surpassed, and (as <hi>Erasistratus</hi> says) has nothing idle or frivolous; how she, I say, has contrived all things pertaining to the Procreation of Mankind; for Modesty will not permit it. The making and Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Milk sufficiently speak her Providence and Care. In Women, what Blood abounds more than serves for necessary Uses, and through its Languidness and Want
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46327:118"/> of Spirit, wandring about, disturbs the Body; that at other times is by Nature in monthly Periods discharged by proper Canals and Passages, for the Relief and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Body, and to render the Womb like a Field fit for the Plow and Seed, and desirous of it at Seasons. But when the Womb has caught the Seed, and it has takeen Root (for the Navil, as <hi>Democritus</hi> says, grows first, like an Anchor to keep the <hi>Foetus</hi> from fluctuating, or as a Stay or Footstalk to the Child) then Nature stops the Passages proper for monthly Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and keeps the superfluous Blood then for Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and waters the Birth with it, which is formed and fashioned, till at a set number of Days it encreases in the Womb, and seeks another place, and other sort of Food. Then Nature, more diligent then any Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-Man, deriving the Blood to other Uses, has as it were some subterranean Fountains, which receive the affluent Liquors, and they receive them not negligently nor without Affection; but with the gentle Heat and womanish Softness, concoct, mollifie and alter them; for in this manner are the Breasts internally affected and tempered. And Milk is not poured out of them by Pipes in a full Stream; but the Breasts terminating in Flesh, that is pervious by small and insensible Passages, do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford store of sweet and pleasant Sucking. But for all this, such and so many Instruments for Procreation, such Preparation, so great Industry and Providence were all to no purpose, unless Nature had inbred in the Mothers a Love and Care of their Off-spring.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Than Man more wretched nought takes Breath,</l>
                  <l>Not th' vilest thing that creeps on Earth.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Which infallibly holds good of Infants new born. For nothing can be beheld so imperfect, helpless, naked, shapeless and nasty, as Man is just at his Birth; to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46327:118"/> whom alone almost Nature has denied a cleanly Passage into the World; but as he is smeered with Blood, and daub'd with Filth, more like to one kill'd than new-born, he could never be touch'd, taken in Arms, kiss'd, or hugg'd, but that Nature bears an inbred Affection for him. Therefore other Animals have their Dugs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Belly, they grow on Woman above her Breast, that she may the more conveniently kiss, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and cherish her Infant, because the end of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth and rearing, is not Necessity but Love. For let us look back to ancient Times; those who first brought forth, and who first saw a Child born, upon them certainly no Law enjoyn'd any Necessity of Rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Off-spring, nor could Expectation of Thanks oblige them to feed their Infants, as if it were for Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Nay rather, they were angry with their Children, and long remembred the Injuries they had received from their Young, as Authors of so many Dangers, and of so much Travail and Pain to them.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>As when Big-belly, struck with Dart</l>
                  <l>Of Child bed Pains, is toucht to th' Heart;</l>
                  <l>Then Man or Midwife shew your Art!</l>
               </q>
               <p>These Rhymes, some say, were not written by <hi>Homer,</hi> but by some <hi>Homeress,</hi> who either had been, or was then in Travail, and felt the very Pangs in her Bowels. Yet Love implanted by Nature, melts and sways the Child-bed Woman. While she is all in a Sweat and trembling for Pain, she is not averse to her Infant; but turns it to her, smiles on it, hugs and kisses it: Though she finds no true Sweetness, nor yet Profit, however, she some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Rocks it in a warm Cradle, sometimes she Dances it in the cool Air, turning one Toil into another, rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither Night nor Day. He that plants a Vine in the Vernal Aequinox, gathers Grapes upon it in the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46327:119"/> Autumnal. He that sows Wheat at the Setting of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> reaps it at their Rising. Cows, Mares and Birds bring forth Young ready for use. Man's Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laborious, his Increase slow, his Vertue lies at a distance; so that most Parents dye before their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren show their Vertue. <hi>Niocles</hi> never saw <hi>Themistocles</hi> his Victory at <hi>Salamis;</hi> nor <hi>Miltiades</hi> the Valour of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> at <hi>Eurymedon; Xanthippus</hi> never heard <hi>Pericles</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nor <hi>Aristo Plato</hi> Philosophizing; nor did the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Sophocles</hi> know the Victories their Sons won: They heard them indeed Stammering and Learning to Talk. It is the Fathers hap to see the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, Drinking, and Love Intreagues of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: To which purpose that of <hi>Ennius</hi> is memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <q>The Son to's Father always is a Grief.</q>
               <p>And yet Men find no end of rearing of Children; they especially who have no need of Children. For it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to think, that Rich Men, when they have Children born to them, do Sacrifice, to the end they may have some to maintain them, and to bury them. Surely they bring not up Children for want of Heirs, as if, forsooth, Men could not be found to accept of another Man's Estate. Sand, Dust, and the Feathers of all the Birds in the World are not so numerous as Heirs are to other Mens Estates. <hi>Danaus</hi> was the Father of fifty Daughters; who, if he had wanted Issue, had had many more Heirs. The Case is far otherwise with Children, they make not Acknowledgments, nor curry Favour, nor pay their Devotions, as expecting the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of due. But you may hear Strangers talk to them that want Heirs, like the <hi>Comedian.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Fall too! Feed! You're welcome! <hi>[Aside]</hi> The Fellow's Rich.</q>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:46327:119"/>
               <p>And what <hi>Euripides</hi> said,
<q>
                     <l>By Money 'tis, Men gain Friends,</l>
                     <l>By Money Mortals gain their Ends.</l>
                  </q> Does not universally hold true; but of such only, as have no Children. To such the Rich lend Money, such great Men Honour, and for such only Lawyers plead <hi>Gratis. A rich Man, who has no known Heir, can do great Matters.</hi> Many a Man, who has had a great Number of Friends and Followers, as soon as he has had a Child, has been divested of all his Alliances and Power. So that Children do not augment a Man's Power: But Nature's Almighty Power is shown no less in Men than in Beasts. For these and many other things are choaked by Vices, as when a wild Forrest is sown with Garden-Seeds. Can we say, that Man loves not himself, because some hang themselves, others break their own Necks, <hi>Oedipus</hi> put out his own Eyes, and <hi>Hegesias,</hi> by his Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, perswaded many of his Auditors to kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <q>For fatal things in various Shapes do walk.</q>
               <p>But all these things are Disease and Craziness of Mind, degenerating from its own Nature. And in this Men testifie against themselves. For if a Sow or a Bitch kill the Young they have brought forth, Men look dejected, are disturbed, sacrifice to the Gods to avert the Mischief, and do account it a Miracle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Men know that Nature has implanted in all Creatures the Love of their Young, so as they should feed them, and not kill them. For as among Metals, Gold, though mixt with much Rubbage, will appear; so Nature, even in vitious Deeds and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46327:120"/> Affections, declares the Love to Posterity. For poor People do not rear their Children, fearing that if they should not be well Educated, they would prove Slavish, Clownish, and destitute of all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. So they cannot endure to entail Poverty, Which they look upon as the worst of all Evils or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases upon their Posterity.</p>

                  <hi>Ion</hi> the Poet, has written somewhere in Prose, That <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> though they be very much different from one another, are nevertheless the Causes of the very same Effects: Both of them do advance and adorn Men, both do raise them to Glory, Power and Empire. It were needless to multiply Instances by a long Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of Particulars, when even <hi>Nature</hi> it self, which produces all things, is by some reputed <hi>Fortune,</hi> and by others <hi>Wisdom:</hi> And therefore the present Controversie will conciliate great Honour and Veneration to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome,</hi> since she is thought worthy of the same Enquiry which uses to be made concerning the Earth and Seas, the Heavens and the Stars, whether she ows her Being to <hi>Fortune</hi> or to <hi>Providence.</hi> In which Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, I think it may be truly affirm'd, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the fierce and lasting Wars which have been between <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> they did both amicably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to rear up the Structure of her vast Empire and Power, and joyn their united Endeavors to finish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he most beautiful Work that ever was of Human Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. It was the Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> that the whole World was composed of Fire and Earth, as necessary First Principles, which being mixed together, did ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it visible and tangible, the Earth contributing weight and firmness, while the Fire gave Colour, Form and Motion to the several Parts of Matter; but for the Tempering and Union of these Extreams, he thought it necessary, that the Water and Air, being of a middle Nature, should mitigate and rebate the contrary Force in Composition. After the same manner did <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> who laid the Foundations of <hi>Rome,</hi> conjoyn and mingle <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> together, that by the Union of their several Powers, they might compose a <hi>Vesta,</hi> truly sacred and beneficent to all Men, which should be a firm Stay, an eternal Support, and a steddy Anchor (as <hi>Democritus</hi> calls it) amidst the fluctuating and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46327:121"/> Affairs of Human Life. For as Naturalists say, That the World was not framed at first into that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Order and Structure which we now behold, for want of the Union and Mixture of these several Bodies that compose it; but that all things did fluctuate a long while in Confusion and Noise, whilst the little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being variously moved, avoided all Connexion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the greater Bodies already compacted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of contrary Natures, did frequently justle and jar one against another; until such time as the <hi>Earth</hi> being fram'd of them both in its due Magnitude, was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht in its proper Place, and by its Stability, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to all the other Bodies of the Universe, either to settle upon it, or round about it; just so it happen'd to the greatest Kingdoms and Empires of Men, which were long toss'd with various Chances, and broken in pieces by mutual Clashings. That for want of one Supream God over all, the Earth was fill'd with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Calamities, by the continual Broils and Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of every aspiring Pretender, until such time as <hi>Rome</hi> was raised to its just Strength and Greatness, which comprehending under her Power many strange Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and even Transmarine Dominions, did lay the Foundation of Firmness and Stability to the greatest of Human Affairs; for by this vast Compass of one and the same Empire, Government was secur'd as in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Circle, resting upon the Center of Peace. Whosoever therefore contriv'd and compass'd these great Designs, must not only be endow'd with all <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> but likewise be assisted by <hi>Fortune</hi> in many things, as will plainly appear from the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>And now methinks I behold, as from a Turret, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> coming to this Conference. As to <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> her Gate is modest, her Countenance Grave, the blushing Colour of her Face shows her earnest Desire
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46327:122"/> of obtaining Victory and Honour in this Contest; <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> in her hasty Pace leaves her far behind, but she is led and accompanied by many brave and gallant Men, who are all over the Body full of Wounds, distilling Blood mingled with Sweat, and they lean upon the bending Spoils of their Enemies. If you inquire who they are, they answer, We are of the <hi>Fabricii, Camilli,</hi> and <hi>Lucii,</hi> and <hi>Cincinnati,</hi> and <hi>Maximi Fabii,</hi> and <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii Marcelli,</hi> and the <hi>Scipio's,</hi> who have suffered so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Deaths for defending and enlarging the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by our Magnanimity and Courage. I perceiv'd also in the Train of <hi>Vertue, C. Marius</hi> angry with <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> and <hi>Mutius Scaevola</hi> holding out his burning Hand, and crying with a loud Voice, <hi>Will ye attribute this to</hi> Fortune <hi>also?</hi> and <hi>M. Horatius Cocles,</hi> who behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self gallantly at the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> when he cut the Bridge and swam over, being loaded with <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> Darts, and drawing his lame Foot out of the deep Water, thus expostulates, <hi>Was I also thus maim'd by meer Chance?</hi> Was there nothing of <hi>Vertue</hi> in this bold Action? Such is the Company of <hi>Vertue,</hi> when she comes to the Dispute, a Company powerful in Arms, terrible to their falling Enemies. But as to <hi>Fortune,</hi> her Gate was hasty, her Looks fierce, her Hope arrogant, and leaving <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> far behind her, she enters the Lists; not as she is described with her light Wings, ballancing her self in the Air, or lightly tripping with her Tiptoes upon the Convexity of the Globe, as if she were presently to vanish away out of sight. No, she does not appear here in any such doubtful and uncertain Posture: But, as the <hi>Spartans</hi> say, that <hi>Venus,</hi> when she passed over <hi>Eurota,</hi> put off her Gew-Gaws and Female Ornaments, and arm'd her self with Spear and Shield for the Love of <hi>Lycurgus:</hi> So <hi>Fortune</hi> having deserted the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Assyrians,</hi> did swiftly fly over <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and quickly threw off her Favorite <hi>Alexander the Great;</hi> and after
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46327:122"/> that, having pass'd through the Countries of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and oftentimes by turns supported the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> she did at last fly over <hi>Tiber</hi> to the <hi>Palatine Mount,</hi> and there she put off her Wings, her Mercurial Shoes, and left her slippery and deceitful Globe: Thus she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Rome,</hi> as one that was to be resident there, and thus she comes to the Bar in this Controversie; she is no more uncertain, as <hi>Pindar</hi> describes her, she does henceforth steer a double Course, but continues constant to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and therefore may be call'd the Sister of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and the Daughter of <hi>Providence,</hi> as <hi>Aleman</hi> describes her Pedigree. This is certain in the Opinion of all Men, that she holds in her Hand the <hi>Horn of Plenty,</hi> not that which is fill'd with verdant Fruits, but that which pours forth abundance of all things, which the Earth or the Sea, the Rivers or the Metals, or the Harbors afford. Several illustrious and famous Men were seen to accompany her, <hi>Pompilius Numa</hi> from the <hi>Sabines,</hi> and <hi>Priscus</hi> from the <hi>Tarquinians,</hi> whom, being Foreigners and Strangers, <hi>Fortune</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to the Soil of <hi>Romulus: Aemilius Paulus</hi> also bringing back his Army from <hi>Perseus</hi> and the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and triumphing in an unbloody and entire Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, does greatly magnifie and extol <hi>Fortune.</hi> The same does <hi>Caecilius Metellus,</hi> that brave old Gentleman, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Macedonicus,</hi> from his many Victories, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Interment, whose Corps was carried forth to its Funerals by his four Sons, <hi>Q. Balearicus, L. Diadematus,</hi> or <hi>Vittatus, M. Metellus,</hi> and <hi>C. Caprarius,</hi> and his two Sons-in-Law, who were all six his Daughters Sons, of <hi>Consular</hi> Dignity; and also attended by his two Nephews, who were famous for the good Offices they did to the Common-wealth, both abroad, by their Heroical Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and at home by the Administration of Justice. <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Scaurus,</hi> from a mean Estate, and a meaner Family, was raised by <hi>Fortune</hi> to that height of Dignity, that he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46327:123"/> was chosen Prince of the Senate. It was <hi>Fortune</hi> that took <hi>Cornelius Sylla</hi> out of the Bosom of <hi>Nicopolis</hi> the Whore, and exalted him above the <hi>Cimbrian</hi> Triumphs of <hi>Marius,</hi> and the Dignity of his Seven Consulships, giving him at once the Powers of a <hi>Monarch</hi> and a <hi>Dictator;</hi> upon which account he adopted himself and all his memorable Actions to <hi>Fortune,</hi> crying out with <hi>OEdipus</hi> in <hi>Sophocles, I think my self the Son of</hi> Fortune. In the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue, he was call'd <hi>Felix,</hi> the Happy, but he writ himself to the <hi>Greeks, L. Cornelius Sulla Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nustus, i. e.</hi> Beloved of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is also the Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on all his Trophies, both at <hi>Chelonaea</hi> with us, and <hi>Mithidratium,</hi> and that not without reason, since it is not the <hi>Night,</hi> as <hi>Menander</hi> thought, but <hi>Fortune</hi> that enjoys the greatest part of <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, having made a seasonable beginning in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Fortune,</hi> we may now call in for Witnesses in this Cause the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, who attributed more to <hi>Fortune</hi> than to <hi>Vertue;</hi> for the Temple of <hi>Vertue</hi> was but lately built by <hi>Scipio Numantinus,</hi> a long time after the building of the City. And after that <hi>Marcellus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated a Temple to <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Aemilius Scaurus,</hi> who liv'd in the time of the <hi>Cimbrian</hi> War, founded another to <hi>Mens</hi> [the <hi>Mind</hi>] when now by the Subtilties of Sophisters, and Encomiastics of Orators, these things begun to be mightily extoll'd; to this very Day there is no Temple built to <hi>Temperance, Patience, Magnanimity</hi> and <hi>Continence.</hi> But the Temples dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Fortune</hi> are splendid and ancient, almost as old as the first Foundations of <hi>Rome</hi> it self. The first that built Her a Temple, was <hi>Ancus Martius,</hi> born of the Sister of <hi>Nurna,</hi> being the Fourth King from <hi>Romulus,</hi> and he seems to have made <hi>Fortune</hi> Surname to <hi>Fortitude,</hi> to which she contributes very much for obtaining Victory. The <hi>Romans</hi> built the Temple of <hi>Feminine Fortune,</hi> when by the help of the Women they turn'd back <hi>Marcius
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46327:123"/> Coriolanus,</hi> leading up the <hi>Volsci</hi> against the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> for the Women being sent Ambassadors to him, together with his Mother and Wife, prevail'd with the Man to spare the City at that time, and draw off the Army of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> It's said that this Statue of <hi>Fortune,</hi> when it was consecrated, utter'd these Words, <hi>It was piously done, O ye City Matrons, to dedicate me by the Law of your State.</hi> But which is more remarkable, <hi>Furius Camillus</hi> having extinguisht the Flame that broke out from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and rescued <hi>Rome</hi> from the Ballance and Scales, in which her Price was weigh'd to them in Gold, did not upon this Occasion found a Temple to <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Fortitude,</hi> but to <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Chance;</hi> which he built hard by the <hi>New-way,</hi> in that very Place, where it's said, That <hi>M. Caedicius</hi> walking in the Night-time, heard a Prophetical Voice, commanding him shortly to expect a War from the <hi>Gauls.</hi> The Image of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> call'd the <hi>Stout and Valiant,</hi> having the Power of Conquering all things, which is consecrated near the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> has a stately Temple built to it, in these very Gardens which were left by <hi>Caesar,</hi> as a Legacy to the People, because they thought that he also was rais'd to the height of Power, by the Favour of <hi>Fortune.</hi> And so he himself testified (otherwise I should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd to say such a thing of so great a Person.) For when he loos'd from <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and embarkt in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of <hi>Pompey,</hi> on the fourth Day of <hi>January,</hi> though it were then the latter end of Winter, he past over the Sea in Safety, by the good Conduct of <hi>Fortune,</hi> which was stronger than the Rigor of the Season. And when he found <hi>Pompey</hi> powerful by Sea and Land, with all his Forces lying together, and that himself with his small Party was altogether unable to give him Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, while the Army of <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Sabinus</hi> lagg'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, he ventur'd to set forth again in a little Bark, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known either to the Master of the Vessel or the Pilot,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46327:124"/> who took him for some Servant: But when he saw the Pilot begin to change his Purpose of putting out to Sea, because of the Violence of the Waves, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, the Sailing out at the Mouth of the River, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently pluckt off the Disguise from his Head, and show'd himself, encouraging the Pilot in these Words, <hi>Put on, brave Fellow, and fear nothing, but commit the Sails to</hi> Fortune, <hi>and expose all boldly to the Winds, because thou carriest</hi> Caesar, <hi>and</hi> Caesar's Fortune. So resolute was <hi>Casar</hi> upon this Assurance, That <hi>Fortune</hi> did favour him in his Voyages and Journeys, his Armies and Battels, and that it was her Province to give Calmness to the Sea, and Warmth to a Winter Season; to give Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Slowest, and Vigor to the most Sluggish Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and which is more incredible than all this, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that <hi>Fortune</hi> put <hi>Pompey</hi> to flight, and gave <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the Opportunity of Murthering his Guest, so that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> should fall, and <hi>Caesar</hi> be innocent. What shall I say of his Son, the first that had the Honour to be Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Augustus?</hi> Did not he pray the Gods for his Nephew, when he sent him forth to Battel, to grant him the Courage of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the Wisdom of <hi>Pompey,</hi> but his own <hi>Good Fortune,</hi> as counting her the chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer of his Wonderful Self? It was she that impos'd him upon <hi>Cicero, Lepidus, Pansa, Hortius</hi> and <hi>M. Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and by their Victories and famous Exploits, by their Navies, Battels and Armies, rais'd him to the greatest height of Power and Honour, degrading them by whose Means he was thus advanc'd: For it was to him that <hi>Cicero</hi> govern'd the State by wise Counsels, <hi>Lepidus</hi> conducted the Armies, and <hi>Pansa</hi> gain'd the Victories. It was to him that <hi>Hortius</hi> fell as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and for his Benefit <hi>M. Anthony</hi> committed licentious Outrages: Nay, even <hi>Cleopatra</hi> her self is to be reckon'd as part of his <hi>Good Fortune;</hi> for, by her, as a dangerous Creek, <hi>Anthony</hi> was Shipwrackt, that he alone might
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46327:124"/> wear the Title of <hi>Caesar.</hi> It is reported of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> call'd <hi>Augustus,</hi> when they liv'd familiarly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in daily Conversation, that <hi>Anthony</hi> was always beaten by <hi>Caesar</hi> at Ball, Dice and Cock-fighting, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Games and Sports which they used for Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereupon a certain Friend, who pretended to the Art of Divination, did freely admonish <hi>Anthony,</hi> and say, <hi>What have you to do, my Friend, with this young Man? why don't you avoid his Company? You excel him in Glory and Largeness of Empire, you exceed him in Age and Experience, having signaliz'd your Valour in the Wars. But your Genius is afraid of his, your Fortune, which is great by it self, does fawn upon his, and will undoubtedly pass over to him, unless you remove your self to a great Distance.</hi> By these Testimonies of Men, the Cause of <hi>Fortune</hi> was supported; after which, I proceed now to other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, taken from the things themselves, beginning from the first Foundations of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first of all, it cannot be deny'd, That by the Birth and Preservation of <hi>Romulus,</hi> by his Education and Growth, the Foundations of <hi>Vertue</hi> were first laid, but then withal it must be acknowledg'd, that <hi>Fortune</hi> built upon them. As to their Greatness and Birth, who first founded and built the City, it lookt like a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Good Fortune,</hi> that their Mother should conceive by a God; for as <hi>Hercules</hi> is said to be sown in a long Night, the natural Day being preternaturally prolong'd by the Sun's standing still: So it is reported concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Greatness of <hi>Romulus,</hi> that the Sun was eclipsed at the time, being in Conjunction with the Moon, as the Immortal God <hi>Mars</hi> was with the Mortal <hi>Sylvia.</hi> The same is said to have happen'd about the time of his Death: For about the seventh of <hi>July,</hi> call'd <hi>Nonae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pratinae,</hi> so call'd, because on that Day, while he was numbring his People by the Lake <hi>Capra,</hi> he suddenly disappear'd (which is a Feast observ'd to this Day with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46327:125"/> great Solemnity) while the Sun was under an Eclipse, he suddenly vanisht out of the Sight of Men. After their Nativity, when the Tyrant would have murder'd the new-born Babes, <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Fortune,</hi> concern'd for the Preservation of their Lives, they fell into the Hands of a Servant, no ways Barbarous and Cruel, but Pitiful and Tender-hearted, who laid them on the pleasant green Bank of a River, in a Place shaded with lowly Shrubs, near to that wild Fig-tree, to which the Name of <hi>Ruminalis</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards given. There it was that a She-Wolf, having left her young Whelps, by chance lighted on them, and being burden'd with her swoln Dugs, inflam'd for want of Evacuation, she gladly let down her over-heated Milk, as if it had been a second Birth, and suckled the young Children. The <hi>Woodpecker</hi> also, a Bird Sacred to <hi>Mars,</hi> came often unto them, and having gently plac'd her Claws upon their tender Bodies, she did by turns, open both their Mouths with her Bill, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto each of them convenient Gobbets of her own Food. This Fig-tree was therefore called <hi>Ruminalis,</hi> from <hi>Ruma, i. e.</hi> the Dug, which the Woolf lying down there gave to the Infants. And from a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this strange Chance of <hi>Romulus,</hi> whenever the like happen'd, the Inhabitants thereabout would not suffer any New Births to lie expos'd to Danger, but carefully took them up and foster'd them. Above all things, the hidden Craft of <hi>Fortune</hi> appear'd in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation at the City <hi>Gabii,</hi> for there they were secretly nurst and brought up, and the People knew nothing of their Pedigree, that they were the Sons of <hi>Sylvia,</hi> and the Grand-children of King <hi>Numitor;</hi> which seems to be so order'd on purpose to prevent that untimely Death which the Knowledge of their Royal Race would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and to give them opportunity of shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves hereafter by their famous Exploits, and discovering
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46327:125"/> the Nobility of their Extraction by their Heroical Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And this brings to my Mind the Saying of that great and wise Commander <hi>Themistocles,</hi> to some of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captains, who having follow'd him in the Wars with good Success, were grown ambitious to be preferr'd above him. <hi>There was an eager Contest,</hi> said he, <hi>between the</hi> Festival Day <hi>and the</hi> Day following <hi>for Precedency. Thou,</hi> says the <hi>Following Day, art full of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and Business, but I give Men the peaceful Opportunity of enjoying themselves. Ay,</hi> says the <hi>Festival; that's true, but then I pray you tell me, If I had not been, where had you been?</hi> So says <hi>Themistocles, If I had not preserv'd my Country in the War with the</hi> Medes, <hi>what use would there be of you now?</hi> And after this manner, <hi>Fortune</hi> seems to accost the <hi>Vertue</hi> of <hi>Romulus.</hi> It's true, indeed your Actions are great and famous, by which you have clearly shown that you have descended of the Race of the Gods; but see now how far you come behind me; for if I had not reliev'd the Infants in their Distress, by my Bounty and Humanity; if I had deserted and betray'd them when they lay naked and expos'd, how could you have appear'd with such Lustre and Splendor as now you do? If a She-Wolf had not then lighted upon them, inflam'd with the abundance and pressure of her Milk, which wanted one to give Food unto, more than any Food for her self: If some wild Beast had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to come in her stead, hungry and ravaging for Meat, then there had been no such beautiful and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Palaces, Temples, Theatres, Walks, Courts and Archives, as now you justly glory of; then your Followers had still been Shepherds, and your Buildings Cottages or Stables, and they had still liv'd in subjection to the <hi>Albanian, Tyrrh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nian</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Lords. Certainly the first beginning of all things is of greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and more especially in building of a City. But it was <hi>Fortune</hi> that first gave a beginning to <hi>Rome,</hi> by
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:46327:126"/> preserving the Founder of it in so many Dangers to which he was expos'd: For as <hi>Vertue</hi> made <hi>Romulus</hi> great, so <hi>Fortune</hi> preserv'd him till his <hi>Vertue</hi> did appear. It is confest by all, that the Reign of <hi>Numa,</hi> which lasted longest, was conducted by a wonderful <hi>Good Fortune.</hi> For as to the Story of the wise Goddess <hi>Egeria,</hi> one of the <hi>Dryades,</hi> that she being in Love, converst familiarly with him, and assisted him in laying the Platform and cementing the Frame of the Common-wealth, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be rather fabulous than true, since there were others that had Goddesses for their Wives, and are said to be lov'd by them, such as <hi>Peleus, Anchises, Orion</hi> and <hi>Emathion,</hi> who, for all that, did not live so pleasantly and free from Trouble. But <hi>Numa</hi> seems to have had <hi>Good Fortune;</hi> for, his Domestick Companion and Colleague in the Government, which receiving the City of <hi>Rome</hi> into her protection, at such time as she was tost like a troublesome Sea, by the Wars of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States, and inflam'd with intestine Feuds, did quickly heal these Breaches, and allay these Storms that threatned her Ruine. And as the Sea is said to receive the <hi>Haleyon-Brood</hi> in a Tempest, which it preserves and nourishes; so the People of <hi>Rome</hi> being lately gather'd together after various Commotions and Tossings, were by <hi>Fortune</hi> deliver'd from all Wars, Diseases, Dangers and Terrors, and setled in such a lasting Peace, that they had time and leisure to take root in their New Soil, and grow up securely into a well compacted City. For as a <hi>great Ship</hi> or <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> is not made without many Blows and much Force from Hammers, Nails, Wedges, Saws and Axes, and being once built, it must rest for some time upon the Stocks, until the Bands of its Structure grow strong and tenacious, and the Nails be well fasten'd, which hold its Parts together, lest being launch'd while 'tis loose and unsetled, the Bulk should be shatter'd by the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46327:126"/> Concussion of the Waves, and let in the Water. So the first Artificer of <hi>Rome,</hi> having built the City of rustical Men and Shepherds, as its strong Walls and Ramparts, was forc'd to endure hard Labour, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dangerous Wars against those who oppos'd its first Origination and Institution; but after it was once fram'd and compacted by this Force, the second Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, by the Benignity of <hi>Fortune,</hi> gave it so long Rest and Peace, till all its Parts were consolidated and setled in a firm and lasting Posture. But if at that time, when the City was newly built, some <hi>Porsena</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd the <hi>Etruscan</hi> Camp and Army to the Walls, being yet moist and trembling, or some Warlike Revolter of the <hi>Marsian</hi> Grandees, or some envious and contentious <hi>Lucanus,</hi> such as in later times were <hi>Mulius,</hi> or the bold <hi>Silo,</hi> or the last Plague of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Faction, <hi>Telesinus,</hi> who with one alarm, arm'd all <hi>Italy;</hi> if any of these, I say, had encompass'd the Philosopher <hi>Numa,</hi> with the sound of Trumpets, while he was sacrificing and praying to the Gods, the City being yet unsetled and unfinisht, could never have resisted so great a Torrent and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, nor encreas'd unto so great Numbers of stout and valiant Men: That long time of Peace therefore in <hi>Numa</hi>'s Reign, did prepare and fortifie the <hi>Romans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the Wars which happen'd afterwards, for by its continuance, during the space of forty three Years, the Body of the People was confirm'd in that Athletick Habit, which they acquir'd in the War under <hi>Romulus,</hi> and which generally prevail'd henceforward against all their Enemies. For in these Years they say <hi>Rome</hi> was not afflicted with Famine or Pestilence, with Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Earth, or any notable Calamity by Winter or Summer; all which must be attributed, not to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prudence, but to the good Conduct of Divine <hi>Fortune,</hi> governing for that time. Then the double Gate of <hi>Janus</hi> was shut, which they call the <hi>Gate of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46327:127"/> War,</hi> because it is always open'd in time of War, and shut in time of Peace. After <hi>Numa</hi>'s Death, it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd again, when the War with the <hi>Albanians</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd, which was follow'd with six hundred other Wars, in a continued series of time; but after four hundred and eighty Years, it was shut again, when Peace was concluded at the end of the first <hi>Punick</hi> War, in the Consulship of <hi>C. Atilius,</hi> and <hi>T. Manlius.</hi> The next Year it was open'd again, and the Wars last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until the Victory which <hi>Augustus</hi> obtain'd at <hi>Actium;</hi> and then the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms rested but a little while, for the Tumults from <hi>Cantabria,</hi> and the Wars with the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> breaking in upon them, quickly disturbed the Peace. These things I have added to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this Argument of the Good <hi>Fortune</hi> of <hi>Numa;</hi> and even those Kings which follow'd him, have admir'd her as the Governess and Nurse of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>City-Supporter,</hi> as <hi>Pindar</hi> calls her. For proof of this, we may consider, That the Temple of <hi>Vertue</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> was but lately built, many years after the beginning of the City, by that <hi>Marcellus</hi> who took <hi>Syracuse.</hi> There is also a Temple dedicated to <hi>Mens</hi> [the <hi>Mind</hi>] by <hi>Scaurus Aemilius,</hi> who liv'd in the time of the <hi>Cimbrian</hi> War, when the Arts of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and the Sophistry of <hi>Logick</hi> had crept into the City; and even to this Day, there are no Temples built to <hi>Wisdom, Temperance, Patience</hi> and <hi>Magnanimity.</hi> But the Temples of <hi>Fortune</hi> are many, ancient and splendid, adorn'd with all sorts of Honors, and divided amongst the most famous Parts and Places of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Temple of <hi>Masculine Fortune</hi> was built by <hi>Ancus Martius,</hi> the fourth King, which Name was therefore given it, because <hi>Fortune</hi> does contribute very much to Valor, in obtaining Victory. The Temple of <hi>Feminine Fortune</hi> was consecrated by the Matrons, when they drove away <hi>Marcius Coriolanus</hi> at the Head of an Army marching against <hi>Rome,</hi> as every Body
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46327:127"/> knows. Moreover, <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> who above all the Kings, did most enlarge the Power of the People and adorn the Common-wealth, who first gave order to the Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Militia, who was the first Censor and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer of Mens Lives and Sobriety, and is esteem'd a most wise and valiant Man, even he threw himself upon <hi>Fortune,</hi> and own'd his Kingdom to be deriv'd from her; so great was her Kindness to him, that she is thought to descend into his House by a Window, and there to converse familiarly with him. Upon which account he built two Temples to <hi>Fortune,</hi> one to that which is call'd <hi>Primigenia,</hi> in the Capitol, <hi>i. e.</hi> the first born, as one may expound it; another to that which is call'd <hi>Obsequens,</hi> as being obsequious to his Desires, besides many others. There is also the Temple of <hi>Private Fortune</hi> in the Mount <hi>Palatine,</hi> and that of <hi>Viscous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> which Name, though it seems ridiculous, does by a Metaphor, explain to us the Nature of <hi>Fortune;</hi> that she attracts things at a distance, and retains them when they are brought to contact. At the Fountain, which is call'd <hi>Mossy,</hi> the Temple of <hi>Virgin Fortune,</hi> is still to be seen in the Field call'd <hi>Abescymae.</hi> There is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar also to <hi>Fortune of Good Hope,</hi> in the long narrow Street, without any Passage thorow; and near to the Altar of <hi>Venus Epitalaria,</hi> i. e. <hi>Footwing'd Fortune,</hi> there is a Chappel to <hi>Male Fortune.</hi> Infinite are the Honours and Titles of <hi>Fortune,</hi> the greater part of which, were instituted by <hi>Servius,</hi> knowing that all good Success in Human Affairs, does chiefly depend upon her; more-especially, he had found by experience, That by her Favour he was preferr'd from a Captive and hostile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be King of the <hi>Romans.</hi> For when <hi>Corniculum</hi> was taken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Ocresia</hi> being taken at the same time, she for her illustrious Beauty and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (which the meanness of her <hi>Fortune</hi> could not hide or obscu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46327:128"/>
                  <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> with whom she liv'd as Maid of Honour, till she was marry'd to one of her Favorites, and of them was born <hi>Servius.</hi> Others tell the Story after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, That the Virgin <hi>Ocresia</hi> using often to receive the First Fruits and Libations from the Royal Table, which were to be offer'd in Sacrifice, it happen'd on a time, That when, according to the Custom, she had thrown them into the Fire, upon the sudden Expiration of the Flame, there appear'd to come out of it, the Genital Member of a Man; the Virgin being fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with so strange a Sight, told the whole Matter to Queen <hi>Tanaquil,</hi> who being a wise and understanding Woman, judg'd the Vision to be Divine, and therefore drest up the Virgin in all her Bridal Ornaments and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and then shut her up in a Room, together with this Apparition. Some attribute this Amour to <hi>Lar,</hi> the Houshold God, and others to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> but whichsoever it was, <hi>Ocresia</hi> was with child, and <hi>Servius</hi> being descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of one of them, gives greater Probability to the Story of him, That while he was yet an Infant, his Head was seen to send forth a wonderful Brightness, like Lightning darted from the Skies. But those about <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium</hi> tell this Story after a different manner, That when <hi>Servius</hi> his Wife <hi>Gegania</hi> was dead, he fell into a Sleep through grief of Mind, in the presence of his Mother, and then his Head was seen by the Women encompass'd by Fire; which as it was a certain Token that he was born of Fire, so it was a good Omen of that unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kingdom which he obtain'd after the Death of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> by the means of <hi>Tanaquil;</hi> which is so much the more to be wondred at, because he, of all Kings, was the most unfit by Nature, and averse by Inclination to Monarchical Government, since he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd his Kingdom, and divested himself of Regal Authority, if he had not been hindred by the Oath, which, it appears, he made to <hi>Tanaquil</hi> when she was dying, that he should continue, during his Life, in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46327:128"/> Kingly Power, and never change that Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which he had receiv'd from his Ancestors. Thus the Reign of <hi>Servius</hi> was wholly owing to <hi>Fortune,</hi> both because he receiv'd it besides his Expectation, and he retain'd it against his Will.</p>
               <p>But lest we should seem to shun the Light of bright and evident Arguments, and retreat to ancient Stories, as to a Place of Darkness and Obscurity, let us now pass over the time of the Kings, and go on in our Discourse to the most noted Actions, and famous Wars of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Times. And first of all it must be confess'd, That the Boldness and Courage which are necessary for War, do aid and improve Military Vertue, as <hi>Timothy</hi> says; and yet it is manifest to him that will reason aright, that the abundance of Success which advanc'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire to such vast Power and Greatness, is not to be attributed to Human Strength and Counsels, but to a certain Divine Impulse, and a full Gale of running <hi>Fortune,</hi> which carried all before it, that hindred the rising Glory of the <hi>Romans.</hi> For now Trophies were erected upon Trophies, and Triumphs hasted to meet one another; before the Blood was cold upon their Arms, it was washt off with the fresh Blood of their falling Enemies: Henceforth the Victories were not reckon'd by the Numbers of the Slain, or the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Spoils, but by the Kingdoms that were taken, by the Nations that were conquer'd, by the Isles and Continents which were added to the Vastness of their Empire. At one Battle, <hi>Philip</hi> was forc'd to quit all <hi>Macedonia,</hi> by one Stroke <hi>Antiochus</hi> was beaten out of <hi>Asia,</hi> by one Victory the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> lost <hi>Libya;</hi> but which is yet more wonderful, <hi>Armenia, Pontus, Syria, Arabia,</hi> the <hi>Albanians, Iberians, Hyrcanians,</hi> with those about <hi>Caucasus,</hi> were by one Man, and the Success of one Expedition, reduc'd under the Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The Ocean which is diffus'd over the Face of all the Earth, beheld him thrice Victorious, for he
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:46327:129"/> subdued the <hi>Numidians</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> as far as the <hi>Southern Shores;</hi> he conquer'd <hi>Spain,</hi> which joyn'd with <hi>Sertorius</hi> as far as the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, and he pursu'd the <hi>Albani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Kings as far as the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. <hi>Pompeius Magnus,</hi> one and the same Man, atchiev'd all those great and stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous things, by the assistance of that <hi>Publick Fortune</hi> which waited upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms with Success, and after all this, he sunk under the Weight of his own fatal Greatness. The great Genius of the <hi>Romans</hi> was not propitious for a Day only, or for a little time, like that of the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> It was not powerful by Land only, like that of the <hi>Lyconians,</hi> or by Sea only, like that of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> It was not too slowly sensible of Injuries, as that of the <hi>Persians,</hi> nor too easily pacify'd, like that of the <hi>Colophonians;</hi> but from the beginning, growing up with the City, the more it encreas'd, the more it enlarg'd the Empire, and constantly aided the <hi>Romans</hi> with its auspicious Influence by Sea and Land, in Peace and War, against all their Enemies, whether <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Barbarians.</hi> It was this <hi>Genius</hi> which dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Annibal</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> when he broke in upon <hi>Italy</hi> like a Torrent, and the People could give no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, being torn in pieces by Intestine Jars. It was this <hi>Genius</hi> that separated the two Armies of the <hi>Cimbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Teutonicks,</hi> that they should not meet at the same Time and Place; by which means, <hi>Marius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General encounter'd each Army by it self, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them, which if they had been joyn'd together, would have overflow'd all <hi>Italy</hi> like a Deluge, with three hundred thousand valiant Men, invincible in Arms: It was the same <hi>Genius</hi> that hindred <hi>Antiochus,</hi> by other Occasions, from assisting <hi>Philip,</hi> while he was engag'd in War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> so that <hi>Philip</hi> was first vanquisht before <hi>Antiochus</hi> encounter'd the Danger of helping him. It was by the Conduct of the same <hi>Genius,</hi> That <hi>Mithridates</hi> was taken up with
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46327:129"/> the <hi>Sarmatick</hi> and <hi>Bastarnick</hi> Wars, while the <hi>Marsians</hi> attack'd <hi>Rome:</hi> That Jealousie and Envy divided <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> from <hi>Mithridates,</hi> while the latter was flusht with Success; but both of them were joyn'd together in the Defeat, that they might perish in the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ruine. What shall I say more? Has not <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> reliev'd the City when it was reduc'd to the greatest Extremity of Danger? When the <hi>Gauls</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd about the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and besieg'd the Castle, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Death and Wounds upon the <hi>Romans?</hi> Did not <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> discover their secret Attack in the Night-time, which otherwise had surpris'd all Men? Of which wonderful Accident, it will not be unseasonable to discourse here a little more largely.</p>
               <p>After the great Overthrow and Slaughter of the <hi>Romans</hi> at the River <hi>Alia,</hi> some of those that remain'd fled hastily to <hi>Rome,</hi> and communicated their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Consternation to the People there; of whom a few having trussed up their Bag and Baggage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd themselves into the <hi>Capitol,</hi> resolving there to wait the Event of so dismal a Calamity; others flockt in great Multitudes to the <hi>Veientes,</hi> and there proclaimed <hi>Furius Camillus</hi> Dictator, giving him now in their Distress, an absolute and unaccountable Power, whom before, in their Pride and Prosperity, they had condemn'd and banisht, as guilty of robbing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treasure. But <hi>Camillus,</hi> to strengthen his Title to this Authority, which might seem to be given him only for the present Necessity, contrary to the Law of the State, touching the Election of such a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, scorn'd to call a Senate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> arm'd Souldiers so lately shatter'd and beaten, as if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City were dissolv'd; but sent to acquaint the Senators that were in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and know if they would approve the Election of the Souldiers. To accomplish this, there was one <hi>C. Pontius,</hi> who
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46327:130"/> undertook to carry the News of this Decree to those in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> though it were with great Danger of his Life; for he was to go through the midst of the Enemies, who were entrench'd and kept Watch about the Castle. He came therefore in the Night-time to the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> and by the help of broad Corks, supporting the Weight of his Body, he was carried down the Stream in a smooth calm Water, and safely landed on the other side; from thence he pass'd through Places uninhabited, being conducted by Darkness and Silence, to the Rock on which the <hi>Capitol</hi> was built, and climbing up through its wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rough Passages, with much Labour and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, at last he arriv'd at the <hi>Capitol</hi> it self; where, being receiv'd by the Watch, he acquainted the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators with what was done by the Souldiers, and having receiv'd their Approbation of the Decree of Election, he return'd again to <hi>Camillus.</hi> The next Day after, one of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> by chance walking about this Rock, seeing in one Place the Prints of his Feet, and his Fulls, in another Place the Herbs trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down which grow upon the interspersed Earth, and the plain Marks of his Body in its winding As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent through the craggy Precipice, went presently and inform'd the rest of the <hi>Gauls</hi> of the whole Matter. And they finding that a Way was shown them by the Enemy, resolv'd to follow his Foot-steps, and taking the Advantage of the dead Time of the Night, when all were fast asleep, not so much as a Watch stirring, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tle. But <hi>Fortune</hi> in this case was wonderfully propitious to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in discovering and preventing such an imminent Danger, by the Voice of the <hi>Sacred Geese</hi> which were maintain'd about the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> for the Worship of that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess; for that Animal being wakeful by Nature, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46327:130"/> easily frighted with the least Noise, these <hi>Sacred Geese</hi> had been so much neglected by reason of the Scarcity of Provisions which was in the Castle, that they were more easily waken'd by the approach of the Enemy, out of their light and hungry Sleep, and therefore they presently perceiv'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> appearing upon the Walls, and with a loud Voice flew proudly towards them; but being yet more frightned with the Sight of their shining Armor, they rais'd a louder gaggling Noise, which waken'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the Design, presently beat back the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and threw them down over the Precipices of the Rock; and therefore in remembrance of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Accident, a <hi>Dog fasten'd to a Cross,</hi> and <hi>a Goose ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Bed of State,</hi> upon a rich Cushion, is carried about, even to this Day, in pompous Solemnity. And now who is not astonish'd, that considers how great was the Misery of the City at that time, and how great its Happiness is now at this Day, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Splendor and Riches of its Donatives, the Emulation of Liberal Arts that flourish in it, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Noble Cities and Royal Crowns to its Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the chief Products of Sea and Land, of Isles and Continents, of Rivers and Trees, of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and Fields, of Mountains and Metallick Mines, crowding to adorn and beautifie this Place? Who is not stunn'd with Admiration, at the imminent Danger which then was, whether ever those things should be or no; and at those poor timorous Birds, which first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Deliverance of the City, when all Places were fill'd with Fire, Darkness and Smoak, with the Swords of <hi>Barbarians</hi> and Bloody-minded Men? What a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy of <hi>Fortune</hi> was it, that those great Commanders, the <hi>Manlii,</hi> the <hi>Servii, Posthumii</hi> and <hi>Papyrii,</hi> so famous for their Warlike Exploits, and for the Illustrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that have descended from them, should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46327:131"/> in this Extremity of Danger, by the silly Geese, to fight for their Country Gods and their Country. And if it be true, which <hi>Polybius</hi> writes in his Second Book of those <hi>Gauls,</hi> which then possess'd <hi>Rome,</hi> That they made a Peace with <hi>Camillus,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, as soon as they heard the News of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion that was made upon their Territories by the Neighbouring <hi>Barbarians;</hi> then it is past all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, that <hi>Fortune</hi> was the Cause of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by drawing off the Enemies to another Place, or rather forcing them from <hi>Rome</hi> beyond all Mens Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
               <p>But why do I dwell upon those things, which have nothing of certain or evident Truth, since the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires of those Times have perisht, and the History of them is confus'd, as <hi>Livy</hi> tells us: For those things which happen'd in following Ages, being plain and manifest to all, do sufficiently demonstrate the benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Fortune</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> among which, I reckon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For so soon as a wise Man has utter'd any thing, be it never so short, <hi>Garrulity</hi> swallows it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, like the Sea, and throws it up again threefold, with the Violence of a swelling Tyde. Such was the <hi>Portico</hi> within the City of <hi>Olympia,</hi> call'd <hi>Heptaphonos,</hi> by the Reverberation of one single Voice, causing no less then seven distinct Eccho's; and in like manner, if the least Word light into the Ears of an impertinent Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, presently all the Room-rings with it, and he makes such a Dinn,
<q>
                     <l>That soon the jangling Noise untunes the Strings</l>
                     <l>Of Minds sedately fix'd on better Things.</l>
                  </q> Insomuch that we may say, that the Conduits and Conveyances of their Hearing reach not to the Souls, but only to their Ears. Therefore it is that other People retain what is spoken to them; whereas, whatever is said to talkative People, runs through them as through a Cullender, and then they run about from Place to Place, like empty Vessels, void of Sence of Wit, but making a hideous Noise. However, in hopes that there is yet some room left to try an Experiment for the Cure of this Distemper, let us begin with this golden Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the impertinent Prater.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:46327:133"/>
                  <l>Be silent, Boy; and thou wilt find i'th' end,</l>
                  <l>What Benefits on silent Lips attend.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Among which, two of the first, and chiefest, are, as well to hear, as to be heard. To either of which, these Talkative Companions can never attain; so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy they are still to meet with Disappointments, though they desire it never so much. For as for those other Distempers of the Soul, such as Avarice, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and exorbitant Love of Pleasure, they have this Happiness, to enjoy what they so eagerly covet. But this is that which most afflicts these idle Pratlers, that being desirous of nothing more than of Company that will hear 'em prate, they can never meet with it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that all Men avoid their Society; and whether sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Knot together, or walking, so soon as they behold a Pratler advancing towards them, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently give warning to each other, and adjourn to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place. And as when there happens a deep Silence in any Assembly, so that all the Company seems to be mute, we say that <hi>Mercury</hi> is got among them; so when a Fool, full of Noise and Talk, enters into any Room where Friends and Acquaintance are met to Discourse, or else to Feast and be Merry, all People are husht of a sudden, afraid of giving him any Occasion to set his Tongue upon the Career: But if he once begin to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his Mouth, up they rise, and away they trip; like Sea-men foreseeing a sudden Storm, and rowling of the Waves, when they hear the North-wind begin to whistle from some adjoyning Promontory, and hastning into Harbour. Whence it comes to pass, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can meet with any that are willing, either to Eat, or Drink, or Lodge with them in the same Room, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Road, or upon a Voyage, unless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd thereto by Necessity. For so importunate he
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46327:133"/> is, and in all Places, that sometimes he will pull ye by the Coat, sometimes by the Beard, and sometimes be hunching your Sides to make you speak. How highly then are to be priz'd a swift pair of Legs, according to the Saying of <hi>Archilochus?</hi> Nay, by <hi>Jove,</hi> it was the Opinion of wise <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself: For he being perplext with an Egregious Prater, and tir'd out with his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd Stories, and idle Repetitions of, <hi>And is not this a wonderful thing,</hi> Aristotle? No wonder at all, said he, this; but if a Man should stand still, to hear you prate thus, who had Legs to run away, that were a wonder indeed. To another of the same Stamp, that after a long Tale of a Roasted Horse, excus'd himself by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That he was afraid he had tir'd him with his Prolixity.</hi> No, upon my Word, quoth the Philosopher, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver minded what you said. On the other side, should it so fall out, that there was no avoiding the Vexation of one of these chattering Fops, Nature has afforded us this Happiness, that it is in the Power of the Soul to lend the outward Ears of the Body, to endure the Brunt of the Noise, while she retires to the remoter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of the Mind, and there employs her self in better, and more useful Thoughts. By which means, those Sonorous Bablers are at the same time disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well of Auditors, as of People that believe what they say. All Men look upon their vain Babling with the same Opinion that they have of the Seed of People insatiably addicted to the Use of Women; for as the one is barren and useless for Generation, so is the other void of the end of Discourse, altogether frivolous and impertinent. And yet there is no Member of Human Bodies that Nature has so strongly enclos'd within a double Fortification, as the Tongue, entrench'd Within with a Barricado of sharp Teeth, to the end, that when it refuses to be rul'd by Reason, that holds the Reins of Science within, we should fix our Teeth
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46327:134"/> in it till the Blood comes, rather then suffer the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and unseasonable Dinn. For according to the Saying of <hi>Euripides.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Our Miseries do not spring</l>
                  <l>From Houses wanting Locks or Bolts;</l>
                  <l>But from unbridl'd Tongues,</l>
                  <l>Ill us'd by Prating Fools and Dolts.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And truly, I must tell ye, that they who think that Houses with Bolts and Bars, and Purses without Strings, are of no use to their Masters, yet at the same time sent either Fence nor Door before their Lips; but suffer a continual Torrent of vain and idle Discourse to flow through them, like the Perpetual Flux of Water through the Mouth of the <hi>Pontic Sea,</hi> seem to me to have the least Esteem for Human Speech of all Men in the World. Whence it comes to pass, that they never gain belief, which is the end of all Discourse. For the main Scope and Intention of all Men that speak, is to gain a Belief of what they utter, with those that hear them: Whereas Talkative Noise-makers are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believ'd, let them speak never so much Truth. For as Whear, when crouded into a musty Vessel, is found to exceed in Measure, but unwholsome for Use, so the Discourse of a Loquacious Person swells and enlarges it self with Lyes and falshood; but in the mean time it looses all force of Perswasion. Then again, there is no Man of Modesty and Civility, but would be careful of preserving himself from Drunkenness. For Anger, as some are of Opinion, is to be rang'd with Madness, and cohabits with those that are given to Drink; or rather is a kind of Phrensie it self; though inferiour to it in Continuance of time; but as it is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, far exceeding it, since it is a Madness of our own Choice. Now there is nothing, for which Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46327:134"/> is so much abominated and decry'd, as for that it is the Cause of inordinate and unlimited Babling and Prating.</p>

                  <l>Nor Mimic Dancing, scorn'd by sober Men.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And yet both Singing, Laughing and Dancing, are all but Trifles to that which follows, the Consequences of which are oft times fatal.</p>

               <p>This is that which often times proves dangerous, if not terrible to the Discoverer; and who knows but that the Poet might here design to resolve a Question much disputed among Philosophers? that is to say, what the difference is between being Tipsie and stark Drunk? by attributing to the former, only Mirth and Jollity of Humor; but branding the latter with the foul Reproach of noxious Babling, and Blabbing of Secrets. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverb,
<q>
                     <l>What the sober Heart conceals,</l>
                     <l>That the drunken Tongue reveals.</l>
                  </q> Wherefore it is reported of <hi>Bias,</hi> that sitting very si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at a Compotation, drinking only when it came to his Turn, and being laugh'd at by one whose Tongue run at random, who for his Silence call'd him <hi>Mope</hi> and <hi>Fool,</hi> he made this Reply, <hi>Find me out that Fool,</hi> said he, <hi>that e're could hold his Tongue in his Cups.</hi>

               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:46327:135"/>
               <p>A Noble man of <hi>Athens,</hi> having invited the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Embassadors to a magnificent Feast, at their Request, gave the same Invitation to the most eminent Philosophers in the City to bear them Company. Now when all the rest were propounding of Theams, and raising Arguments <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and others were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Paradoxes, to shew their Wit and Learning; only <hi>Zeno</hi> sate still, so reserv'd and mute, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors took notice of it; and thereupon, after they thought they had open'd his Heart with two or three lusty Brimmers, <hi>Pray tell us,</hi> Zeno, said they, <hi>what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port we shall make concerning thee to our Master?</hi> To whom <hi>Zeno, Nothing more,</hi> said he, <hi>but that there was an old Man at</hi> Athens, <hi>that could hold his Tongue in the midst of his Cups.</hi> Such profound and Divine mysterious Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are Silence and Sobriety: whereas Drunkenness is Loquacious, void of Reason and Understanding, and therefore full of jangling, and impertinent Tautologies. Wherefore the Philosophers, when they come to define Drunkenness, call it a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Madness through immoderate Drinking of Wine. So that Drinking is not condemn'd, provided a Man keep himself within the Bounds of Silence and Moderation; only vain and silly Discourse makes Drinking of Wine to be Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness. He then that is Drunk, is Mad with Wine: But the Tautologizing Babler is every where Drunk; in the Market Place, at the Theatre, in the publick Portico's or Deambulatories, as well by Night as by Day. If he be a Physician, certainly he is more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome then the Disease; if your Companion in a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, more insupportable then the Qualms occasion'd by the Tumbling of the Sea. If he praise thee, his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick's more offensive than the Reproaches of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is a greater Pleasure to converse with vitious Men, so they be discreet in their Language, then with Twatlers, though never so honest. Therefore <hi>Nestor</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:46327:135"/> in <hi>Sophocles,</hi> desirous to appease exasperated <hi>Ajax,</hi> mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus rebuk'd him:
<q>
                     <l>I blame thee not, for though thy Words are ill,</l>
                     <l>Thy Deeds bespeak thee Brave and Valiant still.</l>
                  </q> But there is not the same Excuse to be made for a vain babling Fellow; for the ill Government of his Tongue corrupts and vitiates all the Merits of his Actions. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> had giv'n to a certain accus'd Criminal, an Oration of his own writing. He, having read it several times over, came to <hi>Lysias,</hi> very much dejected, and told him, that upon his first perusal of it, it seem'd to him, to be a most admirable Piece; but after he had read it three or four times over, he could see nothing in it, but what was very dull and insipid. To whom <hi>Lysias,</hi> smiling, <hi>What,</hi> said he, <hi>is not once enough to speak it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges?</hi> And yet do but consider the Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Eloquence and Grace that is in <hi>Lysia</hi>'s Writing, and then I may be bold to affirm,
<q>
                     <l>That no Man living e're was favour'd more,</l>
                     <l>By sacred Muse, that Violet Garlands Wore.</l>
                  </q> Certain it is, that of all the Commendations that were ever given to a Poet, this is the truest, that only <hi>Homer</hi> avoided being irksome to his Readers, as one that was always new, and still flourishing, as it were in the Prime of Poetick Beauty. And yet in speaking thus of himself,
<q>
                     <l>I hate vain Repetitions, fondly made</l>
                     <l>Of what has been already greatly said.</l>
                  </q> He shews how careful he is to shun that Satiety, which as it were, waylays all Tediousness of Speech, alluring
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46327:136"/> the Ear from one Relation into another, and still recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the Reader with fresh Variety, in such a manner, that he never thinks himself satisfy'd. Whereas Men that let their Tongues run at random, rend and tear the Ears with their Tautologies, like those that after Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-books have been newly cleans'd and wip'd, deface them again with their impertinent Scrawls and Scratches. And therefore we would have them to remember this in the first place, that as they who constrain Men to guzzle down Wine unmix'd with Water, and to excess, are the occasion, that what was bestow'd at first on Men as a Blessing, to excite Mirth, and rejoyce the Heart, becomes a Mischief creating Sadness, and caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Drunkenness; so they that make an ill and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate use of Speech, which is the most delighful means of Human Converse, render it both troublesome and unsociable, molesting those whom they think to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, derided by those whose Esteem and Admiration they covet, and offensive to such whose Love and Friendship they seek. And therefore, as he may truly be said to be void of all Civility, who with the Girdle of <hi>Venus,</hi> wherein are all manner of Allurements, drives and chases away his familiar Acquaintance from his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, so he that vexes others with his loose and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Talk, may be as truly said to be a Rustick, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether Education and Breeding.</p>
               <p>Now then among all other Passions and Maladies, some are dangerous, others hateful, and others ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; but in foolish Prating, all these Inconveniencies concur. They are derided when they make Relations of common Matters; they are hated for bringing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome Tidings; they are in danger, for divulging of Secrets. Whereas <hi>Anacharsis</hi> being feasted by <hi>Solon,</hi> was esteem'd a wise Man, for that as he lay asleep after the Banquet was over, he was seen with his Left-hand upon his Privy Parts, and his Right-hand laid upon his
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46327:136"/> Mouth. Deeming, as indeed he rightly believ'd, that his Tongue requir'd the stronger Curb. For though it would be a hard Task to reckon up how many Men have perish'd through Venereal Intemperance; yet I dare say it would be almost as difficult to tell how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities and States have been demolish'd and totally subverted by the inconsiderate Blurting out of a Secret.</p>

                  <hi>Sylla</hi> besieg'd <hi>Athens</hi> at a time when it was certain that he could not lye long before the City, by reason that other Affairs and Troubles call'd him another way. For on the one side <hi>Mithridates</hi> ravag'd <hi>Asia,</hi> on the other, <hi>Marius</hi>'s Party had made themselves Masters of <hi>Rome.</hi> But it happen'd that certain old Fellows being met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Barbers Shop, among other Discourse, blabb'd it out, that the <hi>Heptachalcos</hi> was ill guarded, and that the City was in great danger of a Surprize in that part. Which being overheard, and reported to <hi>Sylla</hi> by certain of his Spies, he presently brought all his Forces on that side, and about Midnight, after a sharp Assault, entred the City with his whole Army, and it was a thousand to one, but that he had laid it in Ashes: However he fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'d the <hi>Ceramicum</hi> with the Carkasses of the Slain, and made the Channels run with Blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly incens'd against the <hi>Athenians,</hi> more for their reproachful Language then their Military Opposition. For they had abus'd both him and his Wife <hi>Metella,</hi> getting up upon the Walls, and calling him <hi>Mulberry strew'd with Dust Meal,</hi> with many other provoking Scoffs of the same Nature; and for a few Jibes and Taunts, which as <hi>Plato</hi> observes, are the slightest things in the World, they drew upon their Heads the severe Punishment of a most dreadful and general Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>The Tongue of one Man prevented <hi>Rome</hi> from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering her Freedom by the Destruction of <hi>Nero.</hi> For
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46327:137"/> there was but one Night to pass before <hi>Nero</hi> was to be murder'd on the Morrow, all things being ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd and agreed on for that purpose. But in the mean time it happen'd that he who had undertaken to execute the Fact, as he was going to the Theatre, seeing one of those poor Creatures that were bound and pinion'd, just ready to be led before <hi>Nero,</hi> and hearing the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low bewail his hard Fortune, gather'd up close to him, and whispering the poor Fellow in the Ear, <hi>Pray only, honest Friend,</hi> said he, <hi>that thou mayst but escape this Day, to morrow thou shalt give me Thanks.</hi> Presently the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low taking hold of this <hi>Enigmatical</hi> Speech, and calling to mind the vulgar Saying,
<q>
                     <l>Where Opportunity presents the Choice,</l>
                     <l>Fools they that wave the most secure Advice.</l>
                  </q> Prefer'd the more probable to be the juster way of sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself, and presently declar'd to <hi>Nero</hi> what that Man had whisper'd in his Ear. Immediately the <hi>Whisperer</hi> was laid hold of, and hurried away to the Place of Torture, where by Racking, Searing and Scourging, he was constrain'd, poor miserable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to confess that by Force, which before he had discover'd without any Compulsion at all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Zeno,</hi> that he might not be compell'd by the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his Body, to betray, against his Will, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets entrusted in his Breast, bit off his Tongue and spit it in the Tyrants Face.</p>
               <p>Notorious also was the Example of <hi>Leaena,</hi> and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal the Reward which she had, for being true to her Trust, and constant in her Taciturnity. She was a Curtesan with whom <hi>Harmodius</hi> and <hi>Aristogiton</hi> were very familiar, and for that reason they had imparted to her the great Hopes which they had upon the Success of the Conspiracy against the thirty Tyrants, wherein
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46327:137"/> they were so deeply engag'd, while she on the other side having drank freely of the Noble Cup of Love, vow'd never to reveal the Secrets which they had made her Privy to, for the Sake of that Deity; wherein she fail'd not of her Vow.</p>
               <p>For the two Paramours being taken and put to Death, after they had fail'd in their Enterprize, she was also apprehended and put to the Torture, to force out of her a Discovery of the rest of the Accomplices; but all the Torments and Extremities they could exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise upon her Body, could not prevail to make her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover so much as one Person; thereby manifesting to the World, that the two Gentlemen, her Friends, had done nothing mis-becoming the Nobility of their Descent, in having bestow'd their Affections upon such a Woman. For this reason, the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as a Monument of her Vertue, set up a <hi>Leaena,</hi> or <hi>Lioness</hi> in Brass, with out a Tongue, just at the Entrance into the <hi>Acropolis</hi> or Cittadel; signifying to Posterity, by the stomachful Courage of that Beast, the invincible Resolution of the Woman; and by making it without a Tongue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting her Constancy, in keeping the Secret with which she was entrusted. For never any Word spoken did so much good, as many lockt up in Silence. Thus at one time or other a Man may blab forth a Secret, but when it is once blurted forth, it can never be recall'd. For it flies abroad, and spreads in a moment far and near. And hence it is that we have Men to teach us to speak; but the Gods are they that teach us Silence; Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence being the first thing commanded upon our first Initiation into their Divine Ceremonies and Sacred Mysteries. And therefore it is that <hi>Homer</hi> makes <hi>Ʋlysses,</hi> whose Eloquence was so charming, to be the most silent of Men; and the same Vertue also he attribu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <l>Although not willing yet to be reveal'd;</l>
                     <l>He would not move his Eyes, but kept them fast,</l>

                  </q> So powerfully possess'd with Continence were both his Tongue and Lips, and having all the rest of his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers so obedient and subject to his Reason, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Eyes not no weep, his Tongue not to speak a Word, and his Heart neither to pant or tremble,
<q>
                     <l>So was his suffering Heart confin'd</l>
                     <l>To give Obedience to his Mind.</l>
                  </q> His Reason penetrating even to those inward Motions, and subduing to its self the Blood and vital Spirits. Such were many of the rest of his Followers. For though they were dragg'd and hal'd by <hi>Polypheme,</hi> and had their Heads dash'd against the Ground, they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a Word concerning their Lord and Master <hi>Ʋlysses,</hi> nor discover the long piece of Wood that was put in the Fire, and prepar'd to put out his Eye; but rather suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd themselves to be devour'd raw, then to disclose any one of their Masters Secrets, which was an Example of Fidelity, and reservedness not to be parallel'd. <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus</hi> therefore did very well, who when the King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> sent him an Oblation-beast, and order'd him to take out and set apart the best and worst Piece of it, pull'd out the Tongue and sent to him, as being the

                  </q> For they that are brought up under a truly generous and Royal Education, learn first to be silent, and then to talk. And therefore King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> when his Son ask'd him, when they should discamp? <hi>What!</hi> said he, <hi>art thou afraid of being the only Man that shall not hear the Trumpet?</hi> So loath was he to trust him with a Secret, to whom he was to leave his Kingdom. Teaching him thereby, when he came to command another Day, to be no less wary and sparing of his Speech. <hi>Metellus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that old Souldier, being ask'd some such Question about the intended March of his Army, <hi>If I thought,</hi> said he, <hi>that my Shirt were Privy to this Secret, I would pull it off and throw it into the Fire. Eumenes</hi> also, when he heard that <hi>Craterus</hi> was marching with his Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, said not a Word of it to his best Friends, but gave it out all along, that it was <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> for him his Souldiers contemn'd, but they admir'd <hi>Craterus</hi>'s Fame and Vertue; but no body knew the Truth but <hi>Eumenes</hi> himself. Thereupon joyning Battle, the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fell to their Side, and they slew <hi>Craterus,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who he was till they found him among the Slain. So cunningly did Taciturnity manage this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and conceal so great an Adversary. So that the Friends of <hi>Eumenes</hi> admir'd rather then reprov'd him, for not telling them before hand. For indeed, should a man be blam'd in such a Case, it is better for him to be accus'd after Victory obtain'd by his Distrust; then to be justly reproach'd for being open and easie to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:46327:140"/> his Secrets, after an Overthrow. Nay, What Man is he that dares take upon him the Freedom to blame another for not keeping that secret which he himself has reveal'd to him? For if the Secret ought not to have been divulg'd, 'twas ill done to break it to another; but if after thou hast let it go from thy self, and wouldst have another to keep it in; surely it is a great Argument that thou hast more Confidence in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother then in thy self; who if he be like thy self, thou art deservedly lost; if better, then thou art mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously sav'd, as having met with a Person more faithful to thee, then thou art to thy own Interest. But thou wilt say, he is my Friend: Very good—Yet this Freind of mine had another, in whom he might confide as much as I did in him; and in like manner his Friend another, to the end of the Chapter. And thus the Secret gains Ground and spreads it self by Multiplication of Babling. For as an <hi>Ʋnite</hi> never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds its Bounds, but always remains One, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd an <hi>Ʋnite;</hi> but then the next is <hi>Two,</hi> the first indefinite Beginning of the Difference, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by doubling, multiplies to Infinite; so Speech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in the first Thoughts, may truly be call'd a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; but being communicated to another, it presently changes its Name into common Rumor. Which is the reason that <hi>Homer</hi> gives to <hi>Words</hi> the Epithete of <hi>Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> For he that lets go a Bird out of his Hand, does not easily catch her again: Neither is it possible for a Man to re-call and cage again in his Breast, a Word let slip from his Mouth. For with light Wings it fetches many a Compass, and flutters about from one Quarter to another in a Moment. The Course of a Ship may well be stav'd by Cables and Anchors, which else would spoom away before a fresh Gale of Wind; but there is no fast Riding or Anchor-hold for Speech, when once let loose, as from a Harbour; but being
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46327:140"/> whirl'd away with a sonorous Noise and loud Eccho, it carries off, and plunges the unwary Babbler into some fatal Danger.</p>

               <p>The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> had been debating among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a certain Piece of Secresie for several Days; which caus'd the Matter to be so much the more sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and listned after. Whereupon a certain <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, discreet enough in other things, but yet a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, laid at her Husband Day and Night, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully importun'd him what the Secret might be. Oaths you may be sure she was ready to make, and curse her self if ever she reveal'd whatever he should tell; nor was she wanting in Tears, and many moist Complaints of her being a Woman so little to be trusted by a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. The <hi>Roman</hi> thus beset, yet willing in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to make tryal of her Fidelity, and convince her of her Folly, <hi>Thou hast overcome me, Wife,</hi> said he, <hi>and now I'le tell thee a most dreadful and prodigious thing. We were advertis'd by the Priests, that a Lark was seen flying in the Air with a golden Helmet upon her Head, and a Spear in one of her Claws; now we are consulting with the Augures and Sooth-sayers about this Portent, whether it be good or bad. But keep it to thy self, for it may be of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the Common-wealth.</hi> Having so said, he walk'd forth toward the Market-place.</p>
               <p>No sooner was he gone, but his Wife catching hold of the first of her Maids that enter'd the Room, and then striking her Breast, and tearing her Hair, <hi>Wo is me,</hi> said she, <hi>for my poor Husband and dearest Country! What will become of us?</hi> prompting the Maid, as if she
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46327:141"/> were desirous that she should say to her again, <hi>Why? What is the matter Mistriss?</hi> upon which she presently unfolded all that her Husband had told her; nay, she forgot not the common Burden with which all Twattle-Baskets conclude their Stories. <hi>But Hussie,</hi> said she, <hi>for your Life, be sure you say not a Word of this to any Soul living.</hi> The Wench was no sooner got out of her Mistresses Sight, but meeting with one of her Fellow Servants that had little to do, to her she unbosoms her self; she, big with the News, with no less speed runs away to her Sweet-heart, who she heard was come to give her a Visit, and without any more to do, tells him all. By this means the Story flew about the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, before the first Deviser of it could get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Presently one of his Acquaintance meeting him, <hi>Did ye come streight from your House?</hi> said he, <hi>Without stop or stay,</hi> reply'd the other. <hi>And did ye hear nothing?</hi> says his Friend. <hi>Why?</hi> quoth the t'other, <hi>Is there any News? Oh!</hi> quoth his Friend, <hi>a Lark has been seen flying i'the Air, with a golden Helmet upon her Head, and a Spear in her Claw, and the Senate is summon'd to consult about it.</hi> Upon which the Gentleman, smiling, <hi>God a mercy Wife,</hi> quoth he, <hi>for being so nimble—one would have thought I might have got into the Market-place before a Story so lately told thee; but I see 'twas not to be done.</hi> Thereupon meeting with some of the Senators, he soon deliver'd them out of their Pain. However, being resolv'd to take a slight Revenge of his Wife, making hast Home, <hi>Wife,</hi> said he, <hi>thou hast undone me—For it is found out that the great Secret I told thee was first divulg'd out of my House; and now must I be banish'd from my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for your wicked gagling Tongue.</hi> At first his Wife would have deny'd the Matter, and put it off from her Husband, by telling him, there were three hundred more besides himself that heard the thing, and why might not one of those divulge it as well
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46327:141"/> as he? But when he bid her never tell him of three hundred more, and told her 'twas an Invention of his own framing to try her, and to avoid her Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Lady was then convinc'd of her Folly, and begg'd her Husbands Pardon.</p>
               <p>Thus this <hi>Roman</hi> safely and cautiously made the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of his Wives Ability to keep a Secret; as when we powre into a crackt and leaky Vessel, not Wine nor Oyl, but Water only.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fulvius,</hi> one of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s Minions and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites, when he heard the Emperor deploring the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of his Family, in regard his two Grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by his Daughter were both Dead, and <hi>Posthumus,</hi> who only remain'd alive, upon an Accusation charg'd against him, was confin'd to Banishment, so that he was forc'd to set up his Wives Son to succeed him in the Empire; yet upon more compassionate Thoughts, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying his Determination to re-call <hi>Posthumus</hi> from Exile; this <hi>Fulvius</hi> hearing, related the whole to his Wife, and she to <hi>Livia. Livia</hi> sharply expostulated the Matter with <hi>Caesar;</hi> wherefore seeing he had projected the thing so long before, he did not send for his Sisters Son at first, but expos'd her to the Hatred and Revenge of him that he had determined to be his Successor? The next Morning <hi>Fulvius</hi> coming into <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and saluting him with a <hi>Hail O</hi> Caesar! <hi>Caesar</hi> retorted upon, <hi>God send thee more Wit</hi> Fulvius. Who presently apprehending the meaning of the Repartee, made hast home again, and calling for his Wife, Caesar <hi>understands,</hi> said he, <hi>that I have discovered his secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and therefore I am resolv'd to lay violent Hands upon my self. And justly too,</hi> said she, <hi>thou dost deserve to dye, since having liv'd so long with me, thou didst not know the Lavishness of my Tongue, and how unable I was to keep a Secret. However, suffer me to dye first; and with that, snatching the Sword out of her Husbands Hand, she slew her
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46327:142"/> self before his Face.</hi> Truly therefore was it said by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippides</hi> the <hi>Comedian,</hi> who being curteously and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly ask'd by <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> what he should bestow upon him of all the Treasure that he had, made answer, <hi>Any thing, O King, but your Secrets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is another Vice no less mischievous, that attends <hi>Garrulity,</hi> call'd <hi>Curiosity.</hi> For there are a sort of People that desire to hear a great deal of News, that they may have Matter enough to twattle abroad; and these are the most diligent in the World to pry and dive into the Secrets of others, which they afterwards enlarge and aggravate with some old Stories and Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of their own. And then they are like Children, that neither can endure to hold the Ice in their Hands, nor let it go. Or rather they may be said to lodge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Secrets in their Bosoms, like so many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, which they are not able to keep there long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they eat their way through. It is said that the Fish call'd <hi>Sea-needles</hi> and <hi>Vipers</hi> rive asunder and burst themselves when they bring forth: In like manner, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets dropping from the Mouths of those that cannot contain them, destroy and overthrow the Revealers.</p>

                  <hi>Seleucus Callinicus,</hi> in a Battel fought with the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> having lost his whole Army, threw away his Royal Diadem, and fled away full speed, wandring through By-Roads and Desarts so long, till at last both Horse and Man began to faint for want of Food. At length, coming to a certain Country-man's House, and finding the Owner himself within, he ask'd him for a little Bread and Water, which the Country-man not only readily fetch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d him, but what else his Ground would afford, he very liberally and plentifully set before the King and his Companions, making them all as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily welcome as it was possible for him to do. At length, in the midst of their Chear, he knew the Kings Face, which overjoy'd the poor Man to that degree, that he
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46327:142"/> should have the Happiness to relieve the King in his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, that not able to contain himself, nor to dissemble his Knowledge of the King; after he had rode a little way with him, and came to take his Leave, <hi>Farewel King Seleucus,</hi> said the poor Man. But then the King stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his Right-hand, and pulling his Host to his Breast, as if he had intended to have kiss'd him, nodded to one of his Followers with his Sword, to strike off the Country-man's Head,
<q>
                     <l>Thus speaking what could scarce be understood,</l>
                     <l>I'th' Dust his Head lies mingl'd with his Blood.</l>
                  </q> Whereas if he could but have held his Peace, and master'd his Tongue for a little while, till the King, as afterwards he did, had recover'd his Good Fortune and Grandeur, he had been doubtless better rewarded for his Silence, then he was for his Hospitality. And yet this poor Man had some colorable Excuse for letting his Tongue at liberty; that is to say, his Hopes, and the Kindness he had done the King. Whereas most of your Twatlers, without any Cause or Pretence at all, destroy themselves; as it happen'd when certain Fellows began to talk pretty freely in a Barbers Shop, concerning the Tyranny of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> that it was as secure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expugnable as a Rock of Adamant, <hi>I wonder,</hi> quoth the Barber, laughing, <hi>that you should talk these things before me, concerning</hi> Dionysius, <hi>whose Throat is almost every day under my Razor.</hi> Which scurrilous Freedom of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being related to the Tyrant, he caus'd him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be crucify'd. And indeed the Gener<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lity of Barbers are a Prating Generation of Men; in regard the most loquacious Praters usually resort to their Shops, and there sit pratling, from whence the Barbers also learn an ill Habit of Twatling. Pleasant therefore was the Answer of <hi>Archelaus</hi> to the Barber, who after he had
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46327:143"/> cast the Linnen Toylet about his Shoulders, put this Question to him, <hi>How shall I trim your Majesty? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more Prating,</hi> quoth the King. It was a Barber that first reported the News of the great Overthrow which the <hi>Athenians</hi> receiv'd in <hi>Sicily;</hi> for being the first that heard the Relation of it in the <hi>Pyraeum,</hi> from a Servant of one of those that had escap'd out of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; he presently left his Shop at Six and Sevens, and flying into the City, as fast as his Heels could carry him,
<q>
                     <l>For fear some other should the Honour claim,</l>
                     <l>Of being First, while he but Second came.</l>
                  </q> Now you may be sure, that the first Spreader of this News caus'd a great <hi>Hubbub</hi> in the City, insomuch that the People thronging together in the Market Place, made diligent enquiry for the first Divulger. Presently the Barber was brought by Head and Shoulders to the Crowd and examin'd; but he could give no Account of his Author, only one that he never saw or knew in his Life before, had told him the News: which so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd the Multitude, that they immediately cry'd out, <hi>To the Rack with the Traytor, tye the lying Rascal Neck and Heels together, this is a meer Story of the Rogues own mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Who heard it? who gave any Credit to it besides himself?</hi> At the same Instant, the Cords were brought out, and the poor Barber was ty'd Neck and Heels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not to his ease you may be sure. And then it was, and not before, that the News of the Defeat was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by several that had made a hard shift to escape the Slaughter. Upon which the People scatter'd every one to his own Home, to make their private Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their particular Losses, leaving the unfortunate Barber Neck and Heels bound fast together; in which condition, he continu'd till late in the Evening, before
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46327:143"/> he was let loose; nor would this reform the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Fool, for no sooner was he at Liberty, but he would needs be enquring of the Executioner, what News, and what was reported of the Manner of <hi>Nici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> the General's being slain. So inexpugnable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible a Vice is Loquacity, gotten by Custom and ill Habit, that they cannont leave it off, though they were sure to be hang'd. And yet we find that People have the same Antipathy against the Divulgers of bad Tydings, as they that drink bitter and distastful Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have against the Cups wherein they drank them.

               <p>It happen'd that the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> in <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> call'd <hi>Chalcioecus</hi> (either because it was built of Brass, or built by the <hi>Chacidians</hi>) was robb'd, and nothing but an earthen Pitcher left behind, which caus'd a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of People, where, while every one spent his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict about the empty Pitcher, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> says one, <hi>Pray give me leave to tell ye my Opinion concerning this Flagon or Pitcher, or what d'ye call it. I am apt to believe that these
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46327:144"/> Sacrilegious Villains, before they ventur'd upon so dangerous an Attempt, drank each of them a Draught of</hi> Hemlock Juice, <hi>and then brought Wine along with them in this Pitcher; to the end, that if it were their good hap to escape without being apprehended, they might soon dissolve and extinguish the Strength and Vigor of the Venom by the Force of the Wine unmixt and pure; but if they should be surpriz'd and taken in the Fact, that then they might dye without feeling any Pain under the Torture of the Rack.</hi> Having thus said, the People observing so much Forecast and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance in the Thing, would not be perswaded that any Man could have such ready thoughts upon a bare Conjecture, but that he must know it to be so. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon immediately gathering about him, one ask'd him, <hi>Who he was?</hi> Another, <hi>Who knew him?</hi> A third, <hi>How he came to be so much a Philosopher?</hi> And at length, they did so sift and canvass, and fetch him about, that the Fellow confess'd himself to be one of those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Sacriledge. And were not they who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd the Poet <hi>Ibicus</hi> discover'd after the same manner, as the sate in the <hi>Theatre?</hi> For as they were sitting there under the open Sky, to behold the publick Pastimes, they observ'd a Flock of Cranes flying over their Heads; upon which they whisper'd merrily one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Look yonder are the Revengers of</hi> Ibycus<hi>'s Death.</hi> Which Words being overheard by some that sate next them, in regard that <hi>Ibycus</hi> had been long missing, but could not be found, though diligent Search had been made after him, they presently gave Information of what they had heard to the Magistrates. By whom being examin'd and convicted, they suffer'd condign Punishment, though not betray'd by the Cranes, but by the Incontinency of their own Tongues; an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging <hi>Erinnys</hi> hovering over their Heads, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining them to confess the Murther. For as in the Body, wounded and diseased Members draw to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46327:144"/> the vicious Humors of the neighbouring Parts; in like manner the unruly Tongues of Bablers, infested as it were with Inflammations, where a sort of feverish Pulses continually lye beating, will be always drawing to themselves something of the secret and private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of other Men. And therefore it ought to be environ'd with Reason as with a Rampart, perpetually lying before it, like a Mound, to stop the overflowing and slippery Exuberance of Impertinent Talk; that we may not seem to be more silly then Geese, which when they take their Flight out of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> over the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> which abounds with Eagles, are reported to carry every one a good big Stone in their Bills, instead of a Bridle or Barricado to restrain their Gagling. By which means they cross those hideous Forrests in the Night time undiscover'd.</p>
               <p>Now then if the Question should be ask'd, which were the worst and most pernicious sort of People? I do not believe there is any Man that would omit to name a <hi>Traytor.</hi> And yet by Treason it was, that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thycrates</hi> cover'd the uppermost Story of his House with <hi>Macedonian</hi> Timber, according to the Report of <hi>Demosthenes:</hi> That <hi>Philocrates</hi> having receiv'd a good Sum of Money, spent it all upon Whores and Fish, and liv'd so voluptuously as he did; and that <hi>Euphorbius</hi> and <hi>Philager,</hi> who betray'd <hi>Eretria,</hi> were so well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with ample Possessions. But a Pratler is a sort of Traytor that no Man needs to hire; for that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himself officiously, and of his own accord; nor does he betray to the Enemy either Horse or Walls; but whatever he knows of publick or private Concerns, requiring the greatest Secresie, that he discloses, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in Courts of Judicature, in Conspiracies, or Management of State Affairs; 'tis all one, he expects not so much as the Reward of being thank'd for his Pains; rather he will return thanks to them that give
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46327:145"/> him Audience. And therefore what was said upon a certain Spendthrift, that rashly, and without any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, wasted his own Estate by his lavish Prodigality to others;
<q>
                     <l>Thou art not Liberal; 'tis a Disease</l>
                     <l>Of vainly giving, which does thee possess;</l>
                     <l>'Tis all to please thy self, what thou dost give,</l>
                     <l>And therefore they ne're thank thee that receive.</l>
                  </q> May be well retorted upon a common Pratler.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Thou art no Friend, nor dost to me impart,</l>
                  <l>For Friendships sake, the Secrets of thy Heart;</l>
                  <l>But as thy Tongue has neither Bolt nor Lock,</l>
                  <l>'Tis thy Disease, that thou delight'st to talk.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Nor would I have the Reader think, that what has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been said, has been discours'd so much to blame and condemn, as to reform and cure that vitious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious Malady of Loquaciousness and Incontinency of Speech. For though we surmount and vanquish the Vices of the Mind by Judgment and Exercise, yet must the Judgment precede. For no Man will accustom himself to avoid, and as it were to extirpate out of his Soul, those Vices, unless he first abominate them. Nor can we ever detest those evil Habits of the Mind as we ought to do; but when we rightly judge by Reason's Light of the Prejudice they do us, and the Ignominy we sustain thereby. For Example, we consider and find that these profuse Bablers, desirous of being belov'd, are universally hated; while they study to gratifie, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come troublesome; while they seek to be admir'd, they are derided. If they aim at Profit, they loose all their Labour; in short, they injure their Friends, advantage their Enemies, and undo themselves.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:46327:145"/>
               <p>And therefore the first Remedy and Cure for this spreading Malady, will be this, to reckon up all the shameful Infamies and Disasters that attend it. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Remedy, is to take into serious Consideration the Practice of what is quite opposite and contrary to it, by always hearing, remembring, and having ready at hand, the due Praises and Encomiums of Reserv'dness and Taciturnity, together with the Majesty, Sanctimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and mysterious Profoundness of Silence. Let them consider how much more belov'd, how much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, how far they are reputed to excel in Prudence, who deliver their Minds in few Words, roundly, home, and Sententious, and contract a great deal of Sence within a small Compass of Speech, then such as fly out into voluminous Language, and suffer their Tongues to run before their Wit. The former are those whom <hi>Plato</hi> so much praises, and likens unto skilful Archers, darting forth their Sentences thick and close, as it were crisp'd and curl'd one within another. To this same shrewdness of Expression, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> accustom'd his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens from their Childhood, by the Exercise of Silence, contracting and thickning their Discourse into a compendious Delivery. For as the <hi>Celtiberians</hi> make Steel of Iron, by burying it in the Ground, thereby to refine it from the gross and earthy Part; so the <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> way of Speech has nothing of Bark upon it; but by cutting off all superfluity of Words, becomes steel'd and sharpen'd to pierce the Understanding of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. So their Conciseness of Language, so ready to turn the Edge to all manner of Questions, became natural by their Extraordinary Practise of Silence. And therefore it would be very expedient for Persons so much given to talk, always to have before their Eyes the short and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Sayings of those People, were it only to let them see the Force and Gravity which they contain. For Example, <hi>The</hi> Lacedaemonians <hi>to</hi> Philip; Dionysius <hi>in</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:46327:146"/> Corinth. And when <hi>Philip</hi> wrote thus to the <hi>Spartans, If once I enter into your Territories, I will destroy ye all, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to rise again.</hi> They answer'd him with no more then, <hi>If.</hi> To King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> exclaiming in a great Rage, <hi>What, have the</hi> Spartans <hi>sent me but one Embassador?</hi> The Embassador nothing terrify'd, <hi>One to One,</hi> said he. Certainly they that spoke short and concisely, were much admir'd by the Ancients. Therefore the <hi>Ampicty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> gave order, that neither <hi>Homer's Iliads,</hi> nor his <hi>Odys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> should be written over the Gates of <hi>Pythian Apollo's Temple;</hi> but, <hi>Know thy self, Nothing too much, Give good Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Mischief at had.</hi> So much did they admire Concise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Speech, comprehending full Sence in so much Brevity, made solid as it were by the Force of a Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Does not the Deity himself study compendious Utterance in the Delivery of his Oracles? Is he not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd <hi>Loxias,</hi> because he avoids rather Loquacity then Obscurity? Are not they that signifie their Meaning by certain Signs, without Words, in great Admiration, and highly applauded. Thus <hi>Heraclitus</hi> being desir'd by his Fellow Citizens, to give them his Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Concord,</hi> ascended the publick Pulpit, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cup of cold Water in his Hand, first sprinkl'd it with a little Flower, then stirring it with a Sprig of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyroyal,</hi> drank it off, and so came down again. Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby, that if Men would but be contented with what was next at hand, without longing after Dainties and Superfluities, it would be an easie thing for Cities to live in Peace and Concord one with another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scilurus,</hi> King of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> left fourscore Sons behind him; who when he found the Hour of Death approaching, ordered them to bring him a Bundle of small Javelins, and then commanded every one singly to try whether they could break the Bundle as it was ty'd up altogether, which when they told him was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to do, he drew out the Javelins one by
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46327:146"/> one, and break them all himself with ease. Thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that so long as they kept together united and in Concord, their Force would be invincible; but that by Dis-union and Discord, they would enfeeble each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and render their Dominion of small Continuance. He then that by often Repetition and Reflexion shall enure himself to such Presidents as these, may in time perhaps be more delighted with these short and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Apothegms, then with the Exorbitances of loose and lavish Discourse. For my own part, I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that I am not a little asham'd of my self, when I call to mind that same Domestick Servant, of whom I am now going to speak, and consider how great a thing it is to advise before a Man speaks, and then to be able to maintain and stick to what he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Publius Piso</hi> the <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> being unwilling to be disturb'd with much Talk, gave order to his Servants to answer to such Questions only as he should ask them, and say no more. Then having a Design to give an Entertainment to <hi>Clodius,</hi> at that time the Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, he order'd him to be invited, and provided a splendid Banquet for him, as in all probability he could do no less. At the time appointed, several other Guests appear'd, only they waited for <hi>Clodius</hi>'s coming, who tarry'd much longer then was expected; so that <hi>Piso</hi> sent his Servant several times to him, to know whether he would be pleas'd to come to Supper, or no. Now in regard it grew late, and that <hi>Piso</hi> despair'd of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>What,</hi> said he to his Servant, <hi>did you call him? Yes,</hi> reply'd the Servant, <hi>Why then does he not come away? — Because he told me he would not come—Why did you not tell me so before?—Because, Sir, you never ask'd me the Question.</hi> This was a <hi>Roman</hi> Servant: But you shall have an <hi>Athenian</hi> Servant, that while he is digging and delving, will give his Master an Account of the Articles
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46327:147"/> and Capitulations in a Treaty of Peace. So strangely does Custom prevail in all things; of which, let us now discourse; for there is no Curb or Bridle that can tame or restrain a Libertine Tongue; only Custom must vanquish that Disease.</p>
               <p>First therefore, when there are many Questions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Company where thou art, accustom thy self to Silence, till all the rest have refus'd to give an Answer. For as <hi>Sophocles</hi> observes,
<q>
                     <l>Although in Racing Swiftness is requir'd,</l>
                     <l>To give Advice, there's no such hast desir'd.</l>
                  </q> No more does Voice and Answer aim at the same Mark. For it is the Business of a Racer to get the Start of him that contends with him. But if another Man give a sufficient Answer, there needs no more then by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending and approving what he says, to gain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Candid Person. If not, then to tell wherein the other fail'd, and to supply the Defect, will neither be unseasonable, nor a thing that can justly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Distaste. But above all things, let us take special heed, when another is ask'd a Question, that we do not chop in to prevent his returning an Answer. And perhaps it is as little commendable, when a Question is ask'd of another, to put him by, and undertake the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of what is demanded our selves. For thereby we seem to intimate, that the Person to whom the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was put, was not able to resolve it, and that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder had not Discretion sufficient to know of whom to ask it. Besides that such a Malapert Forwardness in answering, is not only indecent, but injurious and affrontive. For he that prevents the Person to whom the Question is put, in returning his Answer, would in effect insinuate a <hi>What need had you to ask of him? What can he say to it? When I am in presence, no Man
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46327:147"/> ought to be ask'd those Questions but my self.</hi> And many times we put the Question to some People, not for want of an Answer, but only to minister occasion of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to provoke them to Familiarity, and to have the Pleasure of their Wit and Conversation; as <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to challenge <hi>Theatus</hi> and <hi>Carmides.</hi> Therefore, to prevent another in returning his Answers, to abstract his Ears, and draw off his Cogitations from another to himself, is the same thing as to run, and salute a Man who designs to be saluted by some body else; or to divert his Eyes upon our selves, which were already fix'd upon another. Considering that if he, to whom the Question is put, refuse to return an Answer, it is but decent for a Man to contain himself, and by an Answer accommodated to the Will of the Propounder, modestly and respectfully to put in, as if it had been at the Request, or in the Behalf of the other. For they that are ask'd a Question, if they fail in their Answer, are justly to be pardon'd; but he that voluntarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes to answer for another, gives distaste, let his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer be never so rational; but if he mistake, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided by all the Company.</p>
               <p>The second point of Exercise, in reference to our own Answering of Questions, wherein a Man that is given to talk, ought to be extreamly careful, is first of all, not to be over-hasty in his Answers to such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to talk, on purpose to make themselves merry, and put an Affront upon him. For some there are, who not out of any Desire to be satisfy'd, but meerly to pass away the time, study certain Questions, and then propound them to Persons which they know love to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply Words, on purpose to make themselves Sport. Such Men therefore ought to take heed how they run headlong, and leap into Discourse, as if they were glad of the Occasion; but to consider the Behaviour of the Propounder, and the benefit and usefulness of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46327:148"/> When we find that the Propounder is really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to be inform'd, it is convenient then for a Man to bethink himself a while, and make some Pause between the Question and the Answer, to the end the Proposer, if he pleases to make any Additions to his Proposal, may have time to do it, and himself a convenient space to consider what Answer to make, for fear of running at random, and stifling the Question before it be fully propounded; or of giving one Answer for another, for want of consideration what he ought to say, which is the Effect of an over-hasty Zeal to be talking. True it is indeed, that the <hi>Pythian</hi> Priestess was wont to give her Oracular Answers at the very Instant, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before the Question was propounded. For that the Deity, whom she serves,
<q>
                     <l>Both understands the Mute that cannot speak,</l>
                     <l>And hears the Silent, e're his Mind he break.</l>
                  </q> But it behoves a Man that would return a pertinent Answer, to stay till he rightly apprehended the Sence, and understands the Intent of him that propounds the Question; least he may happen to make good the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>A Rake we call'd for, they half Mad</l>
                  <l>Tell us a Story of a Spade.</l>
               </q>
               <p>There is also another way to subdue this inordinate and insatiate Greediness of having all the Talk, that it may not seem as if we had some old Flux of Humors im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postumated about the Tongue, which we were willing to have lanc'd and let out by a Question, giving occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of lavish Discourse. <hi>Socrates</hi> therefore, though never so Thirsty after violent Exercise, never would allow himself the Liberty to drink, till he had empty'd
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46327:148"/> his Bucket of Water, by pouring it out by degrees; to the end he might accustom his sensual Appetite to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Reason's Appointment.</p>
               <p>Now therefore we come to understand that there are three sorts of Answers to Questions; the <hi>First,</hi> which is necessary, the <hi>Second,</hi> out of Civility, and the <hi>Third,</hi> superfluous. For Example, if a Man should ask, <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Socrates <hi>is within?</hi> The other, if he were in an ill Humor, or not dispos'd to make many Words, would answer, <hi>Not within:</hi> Or if he intended to be more <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conick,</hi> he would cut off, <hi>Within,</hi> and reply briefly <hi>No.</hi> Thus the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> when <hi>Philip</hi> sent them an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,</hi> to know, whether or no they would admit him into their City, vouchsaf'd him no other Answer, then only 'OY or NO, fairly written in Capital Letters, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a large Sheet of Paper. Another, that would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer more courteously, would say, <hi>He is not within; he is gone among the Bankers;</hi> and perhaps he would add, <hi>where he expects some Friends of his out of</hi> Ionia. But a superfluous <hi>Prater,</hi> and one that abounded in Words, would reply, <hi>He is not within, but is gone among the Bankers, in expectation to meet certain</hi> Ionian <hi>Friends, who are recommended to him in a Letter from</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades, <hi>who lives at</hi> Miletum <hi>with</hi> Tissaphernes, <hi>one of the Great King of</hi> Persia<hi>'s Lieutenant Generals, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly assisted the</hi> Lacedaemonians; <hi>but by the Solicitation of</hi> Alcibiades, <hi>is in League with the</hi> Athenians; <hi>for</hi> Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades <hi>being desirous to return to his own Country, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with</hi> Tissaphernes <hi>to change his Mind, and joyn with his Fellow Citizens.</hi> And thus perhaps you shall have him run on, and repeat the whole eighth Book of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides,</hi> and overwhelm a Man with his Impertinent Discourse, till he has taken <hi>Miletum,</hi> and banish'd <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> a second Time. Herein therefore ought a Man chiefly to restrain the Profuseness of his Language, as it were, following the Foot-steps of the Question, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46327:149"/> circumscribing the Answer, as it were within a Center and Distance proportionable to the Benefit which the Propounder proposes to make of his Question. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Carneades,</hi> that before he was well known in the World, while he was disputing in the <hi>Gymnasium,</hi> the President of the Place, sent him an Admonition to moderate his Voice (for he naturally spoke very deep and loud) in Answer to which, when he desir'd the President to send him a Gage for his Voice, the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent not unproperly made Answer, <hi>Let that be the Person who disputes with thee.</hi> In like manner, the intent of the Propounder ought to be the Rule and Measure of the Propounder. Moreover, as <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to say, That those Meats were chiefly to be abstain'd from, which allur'd Men to Eat when they were not a-hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and those Drinks to be refrain'd, that invited Men to drink when they were not a-dry; so it would behove a Man that is lavish of his Tongue, to be afraid of those Discourses and Themes wherein he most delights, and makes it his Business to be most prolix; and whenever he perceives them flowing in upon him, to resist them to the utmost of his Power. For Example, your Martial Men are always talking of Sieges and Battels, and the Poet often introduces<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hector,</hi> as some read it.</note>
                  <hi>Nestor,</hi> boasting often of his own At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements and Feats of Arms. And the same disease is incident to noted Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at the Barr, and accompanies such as have unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly risen to be the Favorites of Great Princes. For such will be always up with their Stories, how they were introduc'd at first; how they ascended by degrees; how they got the better in such a Case; what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they us'd in such a Case; and lastly, how they were humm'd up and applauded in Court. For to say Truth, Gladness and Joy are much more Loquacious then that same <hi>Agrippina,</hi> so often feign'd in their Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46327:149"/> rousing up, and still refreshing it self with new Relations, and therefore they are prone to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such Stories upon the least Occasion given. For not only,
<q>
                     <l>Where the Member most is pain'd,</l>
                     <l>There the Patient lays his Hand.</l>
                  </q> But Pleasure also has a Voice within it self, and leads the Tongue about, to be a support to their Memories: Like Lovers, that spend the greatest Part of their Time in Songs and Sonnets, that refresh their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with the Representations of their Mistresses. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Amours of theirs, when Companions are wanting, they frequently discourse with Things that are void of Life.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Oh dearest Bed, whereon we wont to rest,</l>
                  <l>And undisturb'd the Height of Pleasure Tast.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And again,
<q>
                     <l>O blessed Lamp, for surely thee</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Bacchis</hi> believes some Deity.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And again,
<q>
                     <l>Surely the greatest of the Gods thou art,</l>
                     <l>Or else the She that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es possess my Heart.</l>
                  </q> And indeed it may well be said, that a loose Tongu'd Fellow is no more, in respect of his Discourse, then a white Line struck with Chalk upon a Piece of Timber. For in regard there are several Subjects of Discourse, and that many Men are more subject to some then to others; it behoves every one to take care of all in general, and to suppress them in such a manner, that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46327:150"/> the Delight which they take therein, may not decoy them into their belov'd Prolixity and Profuseness of Words beyond this white Line. The same Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to overshoot themselves in Pratling, appears in such as are prone to those kind of Discourses, wherein they suppose themselves to excel others, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Habit or Experience. For such a one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well a Lover of himself, as ambitious of Glory:
<q>
                     <l>The chiefest Part of all the Day doth spend,</l>
                     <l>In this or that, all others to transcend.</l>
                  </q> For Example, he that reads much, endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in History; the Grammarian, in the Artificial couching of Words; the Traveller is full of his Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy. But all these Surplusages are to be avoided with great Caution, least Men, intoxicated therewith, grow fond of their old Infirmities, and return to their former Freaks, like Beasts that cannot be driven from their Haunts. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore, yet a young Stripling, was most worthy of Admiration, who would never challenge his Equals and Play-fellows to any Exercise wherein he excell'd, but wherein he knew himself to be inferior; unwilling that the first should fret for the Loss of the Prize, which he was sure to win, and loath to loose what he could gain from the others better Skill.</p>
               <p>On the other side, the Profuse Talker is of such a Disposition, that if any Discourse happen, from which he might be able to learn something, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Ignorance, that he refuses and rejects: Nor can you hire him to hold his Tongue; so that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his rolling and restless Fancy has muster'd up some few obsolete and all to be tatter'd Rhapsodies
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46327:150"/> to supply his Vanity, out he flings them, as if he were Master of all the Knowledge in the World. Just like one amongst us, who having read two or three of <hi>Ephorus</hi>'s Books, tir'd all Mens Ears with his Talk, and spoil'd and brake up all the Feasts and Societies where e're he came, with his continual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Battle of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> and the Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it; by which means he got himself a Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, while every one call'd him <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> But this is one of the least Inconveniences of this Infirmity: and indeed we ought to make it one Step toward the Cure, to turn this violent Vein of Twatling upon such Subjects as those. For such a Loquacity is less a Nuissance when it su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabounds in only what belongs to Human Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature.</p>
               <p>It would be necessary also that the same sort of People who are addicted to this Vice, should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom themselves to write upon some Subject or other, and to dispute of certain Questions apart. For <hi>Antipater</hi> the <hi>Stoick,</hi> as we may probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, either not being able, or else unwilling to come in Dispute with <hi>Carneades,</hi> vehemently inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the <hi>Stocks,</hi> declin'd to meet him fairly in the Schools, yet would be always writing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers against him; and because he fill'd whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes full of Contradictory Arguments, and still oppos'd him with Assertions that only made a Noise, he was call'd <hi>Calamoboas,</hi> as one that made a great Clamor with his Pen to no Purpose: So 'tis very probable that such fighting with their own Shadows, and exclaiming one against another apart by themselves, driving and restraining them from the Multitude, would render them more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and sociable in Civil Company. Like Curst Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which after they have once discharg'd their
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46327:151"/> Fury upon Sticks and Stones, become less fierce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Men. It would be always of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to them to converse with their Superiors and Elders; for that the awful Reverence and Respect which they bore to their Dignity and Gravity, might accustom them in time to silence. And it would be evermore expedient for them to intermix and involve with those Rules and Exercises I have already set down, this manner of Ratiocination with themselves, before they speak, and at the same time that the Words are just ready to break out of their Mouths; <hi>What is this which I would say, that presses so hard to be gone? for what reason would this Tongue of mine so fain be walking? What good shall I get by speaking? What Mischief shall I incur by holding my Peace?</hi> For we are not to ease and discharge our selves of our Words, as if they were a heavy Burthen that overloaded us; for Speech remains as well when utter'd, as before; but Men either speak in behalf of themselves, when some Necessity compels them, or for the Benefit of those that hear them, or else to recreate one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with the Delights of Converse, on purpose to mitigate and render more savory, as with Salt, the Toyls of our daily Employments. But if there be nothing profitable in Speaking, nothing neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to them that hear what is said, nothing of Satisfaction or Delight, by being thereby render'd acceptable to all Societies: What need is there it should be spoken? For Words may be in vain, and to no purpose, as well as Deeds. But after, and above all that has been said, we ought always to bear in Remembrance, and always to have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at our Tongues end, that Saying of <hi>Simonides,</hi> That he who is given to Talk, has many times an occasion to repent him of his Words, but never
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46327:151"/> he that can hold his Tongue. Then as for Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, we must believe it to be a matter of great Importance, as being that which overcomes and masters all things; considering what Toi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What needed my Relation, dearest <hi>Flavianus,</hi> such a Proem as this? The occasion that gave birth to these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses requires only a numerous Auditory and a Theater; otherwise there is nothing wanting of an Interlude. Therefore let us first beseech the Mother of the <hi>Muses</hi> to be propitious and assist us in the discovery of the Fable. For my Father, born a long time since before me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving newly espous'd my Mother, by reason of an unlucky variance that fell out between their Parents, took a journey to <hi>Thespiae,</hi> with an intention to Sacrifice to the God of Love, and carry'd my Mother also to the Feast (for that it properly belong'd to her as well to make the Feast, as to perform the Sacrifice) besides se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his familiar Acquaintance that accompany'd him from his House.</p>
                  <p>Now being arriv'd at <hi>Thespiae,</hi> he met with <hi>Daphnaeus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Archidamus,</hi> and <hi>Lysander</hi> in Love with the Daughter of <hi>Simon,</hi> above all her Suitors, chiefly the most welcome and acceptable to her. There he also found <hi>Soclarus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ariston,</hi> who was come from <hi>Tithora;</hi> together with <hi>Protogenes</hi> of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> and <hi>Zeux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> by whom he had been a Guest several times kindly entertain'd, with many other <hi>Baeotian</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:46327:153"/> Gentlemen, with whom my Father was intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. Thus they stay'd for two or three days in the City entertaining each other with learned discourse, one while in the Common wrestling Places, sometimes in the Theaters, still keeping company together. After that, avoiding the Troublesom Contests of the Harpers and Musicians, it being found out that all would be carry'd by anticipation of Parties, the greatest part brake Company, and as if they had been discamping out of an Enemies Country, retir'd to <hi>Helicon</hi> and took up their Lodgings among the Muses. Whether the next morning came to them <hi>Anthemion</hi> and <hi>Pisias,</hi> Persons of eminent Nobility; and both ally'd to <hi>Baccho,</hi> Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the <hi>Fair,</hi> and both I know not how at some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference one with another, by reason of the Affection which they severally bore to him, For there was at <hi>Thespiae Ismendora</hi> of an Illustrious family and wealthy withal; and indeed in all other respects discreet and modest; and moreover she had continu'd a Widow without spot or stain to her Reputation, though both young and beautiful.</p>
                  <p>Now it happen'd that while this Brisk Widow was endeavouring to make up a Match between <hi>Baccho</hi> the Son of a Neighbouring Lady her intimate Friend, and a certain just blooming Virgin nearly ally'd to her self, by often talking with the Young Gentleman and much frequenting his Company, she began to feel some sparks of kindness kindled for him in her own Breast. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hearing him highly commended by others, and speaking many things in his praise her self, and finding him belov'd by a great number of Persons of the best Rank, by degrees she fell desperately in love with the Youth; nevertheless with a resolution to do nothing unbeseeming her Birth and Quality, but after public Wedlock to acknowledge him her Husband: But as the Match seemed impracticable, by reason of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46327:153"/> of their years, so the Mother of the Young Man suspected the Nobility and Grandeur of her House not to be correspondent to her Son's condition, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him uncapable of such a preferment. Moreover his Companions that were wont to go a hunting with him, weighing the difference between his and the Age of <hi>Ismenodora,</hi> filled his head with several scruples, asking him why he did not Marry his Mother, if he wanted an Old woman; and bidding him consider how much it would cost him after a little time in new Sets of Teeth; and thus scaring him with continual frumps and scoffs, more effectually hinder'd the Match, then they who labour'd industriously and seriously to prevent it. But at last, the Young Man, shaking off all others, applys himself to <hi>Pisias</hi> and <hi>Athenion</hi> for their advice in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so great concernment. The Elder of these two, <hi>Ariston,</hi> was his Uncle; and <hi>Pisias</hi> the most austere of all his Lovers. The latter therefore withstood the Match with all his Might, and upbraided <hi>Anthenion</hi> as one that went about to betray the Young Man to <hi>Isme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodora.</hi> On the other side <hi>Anthenion</hi> told <hi>Pisias,</hi> that he did not well to do as he did, having the Reputation of a worthy honest Man, to imitate those leud Lovers, that endeavour'd to deprive their Friend of a Noble House, a Rich Wife, and other corresponding conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, that he might have the Pleasure to see him frequently naked in the Wrestling Places, fresh and smooth, and a stranger to Female Sports. However to prevent the growing of any quarrel between them, through long and Passionate disputes, they chose for Umpires of the Controversie my Father and those Friends that were with him: and besides them, as if they had been chosen on purpose, <hi>Daphnoeus</hi> pleaded for <hi>Pisias,</hi> and for <hi>Anthenion, Protogenes;</hi> who bitterly inveighing against <hi>Ismenodora,</hi> O <hi>Hercules,</hi> cry'd <hi>Daphnaeus</hi> what may we not expect, when <hi>Protogenes</hi> bids defiance to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46327:154"/> Love? He that all along has spent as well the serious as sportive hours of his Life both in Love and for Love, without regard either to Learning or his Country, not like to <hi>Laius,</hi> who was but five days journey distant from it; for his was a slow sort of Love upon the dry Land; whereas your <hi>Cupid, Protogenes</hi>
                     <q>With nimble Wings display'd.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cross'd the Seas from <hi>Cilicia</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> merely to visit and straggle up and down with Lovely Boys. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, such at first was the true cause of <hi>Protogenes</hi>'s Peregrination. At which the Company falling into a loud Laughter, how! said <hi>Protogenes,</hi> can you believe that I at this time wage War against Love, and that I do not rather fight for Love against intemperate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and lascivious Wantonness, which under the shelter of the most honest and fairest Names that are, let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves loose into the most shameful Acts of inordinate Lust and Concupiscence. Then <hi>Daphnaeus,</hi> do ye num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Wedlock, said he, and the Conjunction of Man and Wife (then which there is no Tye more sacred in the World) among the vile and dishonest Actions of the World? Why truly reply'd <hi>Protogenes,</hi> this same Bond of Wedlock, as being necessary for Generation, is not undeservedly perhaps extoll'd by our grave Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians and Lawgivers, and by them recommended to the Multitude. But I must tell ye, if you mean true Love, there is not a Farthings worth of it to be found among Women. Nor do I believe, that either you your selves or any other that dote so much as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do, upon Women and Virgins, love them any otherwise, then as Flys love Milk, or Bees love Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs; only as Cooks and Butchers Fat up Calves and Poultry in the Dark, not out of any extraordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which they bear those Creatures, but for the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46327:154"/> gain which they make of them. Well knowing that Nature prompts all Men to the use of Bread and Meat with Moderation, and so far as may suffice the Appetite. The excess of which becomes a Vice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Gluttony or Gurmandizing. Thus it is natural for Men and Women to desire the Pleasures of mutual enjoyment; but as for that impetuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence that hurries the greatest part of Mankind with so much strength and violence, it is not properly call'd Love. For Love, that is bread in a Young and truly Generous Heart, by means of Friendship terminates in Vertue. Whereas all our Desires toward Women, let them be taken in the best sence we can, serve us only to reap the fruit of Pleasure, and to assist us in the Fruition of Youth and Beauty, which when once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd, we love no longer. As <hi>Aristippus</hi> testified to on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that would have put him out of conceit with <hi>Lais,</hi> for that, as he said, she did not truly love him; no more, said he, am I beloved by pure Wine, or good Fish, and yet I willingly make use of both. For the end of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is Pleasure and Enjoyment. But Love having once lost the hopes of Friendship, will neither tarry, nor cherish, for Beauty sake, that which is Irksom, though never so gaudy in the flower of Youth, if it bring not forth the Fruit of a Disposition propense to Friendship and Vertue. And therefore it is that you hear a certain Husband, in a Tragedy thus talking to his Wife
<q>
                        <l>Thou hat'st me—true— and I thy proud disdain</l>
                        <l>Will brook with patience, careless of the Pain,</l>
                        <l>So long as my Dishonour brings me Gain.</l>
                     </q> Though I take him to be far the more amorous Man of the two, that can endure for the sake of his carnal Pleasure, the Plague of a curst, ill-natur'd shrew, that is always scolding, then he that bears the Infamy of a
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46327:155"/> Cuckold, when his Wife and he are well pay'd for it. The first of which Love Martyrs <hi>Phillippides</hi> the <hi>Comedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> thus derided in the Person of <hi>Stratocles</hi> the Rhetorician.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>She jowrs and growles and turns her Tail</l>
                     <l>With fury so unkind,</l>
                     <l>The Wittal blest would think himself</l>
                     <l>To kiss her Coyf behind.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now if this be the Passion you talk of which is to be call'd <hi>Love,</hi> it is a spurious and effeminate Love, that sends us to the Womens Chambers, as it were to the <hi>Cynosarges</hi> at <hi>Athens.</hi> Or rather, as they say, there is a sort of Generous and true bred Mountain Eagle, which <hi>Homer</hi> calls the black Eagle and Eagle of Prey; and then again there is another sort of Bastard Eagle, that takes Fish and Birds that are Lazy and slow of Flight: and wanting Food, makes a shrill and mournful noise for Hunger. Thus the true Genuine Love is that of Children, not flaming with Concupiscence, as according to <hi>Anacreon</hi> the Love of Maids and Virgins does, neither besmear'd with odoriferous Oyntments, nor alluring with Smiles and rowling Glances: but you shall find him plain and simple, and undebauch'd with pleasures, in the Schools of the Philosophers, or in the Wrestling Lists, and Places of Public Exercise, smart and generous in the Chace of Youth, and exhorting to Vertue all that he finds to be fit objects of his Diligence. Whereas that other Love, Nice and Effeminate, and always nestling in the Bosoms and Beds of Women, pursuing soft pleasures, and wasted with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nmanly Delights, that have no gust of friendship or heav'nly ravishment of Mind, such a Love is to be despis'd and rejected of all Mankind; as <hi>Solon</hi> banish't it out of his Commonwealth, when he forbid Slaves and Servants the use of male Familiarity, but permitted them the Liberty to accompany with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46327:155"/> As looking upon Friendship to be laudable and civil, but Pleasure to be a vulgar thing, and unbecoming a Man born free. Whence it appears that for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to make Love to a Boy, is not allowable but only to a Citizen or a Freeman: for this is no mischievous Love of Copulation, like the affection toward Women.</p>
                  <p>Now while <hi>Protogenes</hi> was desirous to have said more, <hi>Daphnaeus</hi> interrupting him. Truly, said he, you have done well to put us in mind of <hi>Solon,</hi> as if we were to make use of him to be the judge of a Person addicted to Love, that is to say, of a real Lover. Hear what he says.</p>
                  <q>

                     <l>Their fragrant breath admiring and soft Thighs.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Add to this of <hi>Solon</hi> that other of <hi>Aeschylus,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Ingrateful for the Kisses of my Lips,</l>
                        <l>Not to revere the Glory of my Hips.</l>
                     </q> These are proper judges of Love, but others there are who deride all those that would have Lovers inspect their Thighs and Hanches, like so many Sacrificers or <hi>Bowel Observers.</hi> And for my Part I draw from hence a very strong Argument on the behalf of the women. For if Male-Converse, which is altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Nature, neither extinguishes nor is any way noxious to Amorous Affection; much more probable is it, that the Love of Women which is according to Nature, should reach to the consummation of Friendship, by vertue of that Obsequious Beauty which attends it. For I must tell ye, <hi>Protogenes,</hi> the submission of the Female to the Male was by the Ancients express'd by the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <l>T'oblige their Woers; but thy Youth, poor Child,</l>
                        <l>Is yet too raw to be so deeply skill'd.</l>

                     <q>
                        <l>Did you by Force constrain, but ill obey'd,</l>
                        <l>Or by Perswasion win the willing Maid?</l>
                     </q> But the Submission of Males to Males, if it be by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of Strength, is call'd a violent and forcible Rape; but if it be voluntary; for one Man to cover another, like Bulls and Horses, and to conterfeit the Act of Generation, in defiance of Nature, such a one is void of all Allurement, brutish, and contrary to the end of Venereal Pleasure. Wherefore I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Solon</hi> wrote those Lines when he was young, brisk, and full of Seed, as <hi>Plato</hi> phrases it: For when he was grown into Years, he sang another Note;
<q>
                        <l>The Sports of <hi>Venus,</hi> now, are my Delight,</l>
                        <l>Or else with <hi>Bacchus</hi> to carouse;</l>

                        <l>These are the chiefest Pleasures Mankind knows.</l>
                     </q> As if he had alter'd his Course of Life, and retir'd from the Storms and Tempests of <hi>Paderastick</hi> Fury, into the Calms of Wedlock and Philosophy. Now then <hi>Protogenes,</hi> let us but consider the truth of the Matter, we shall find the Passion of Lovers to be the same, whether it be for Boys or for Women; or if out of a contentious Humor, you will distinguish them,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46327:157"/> you shall find that this Affection for Boys does not keep it self within Bounds, but like a late-born Issue, clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinely brought forth in the Dark, and out of Season, strives to expel the truly Genuine and Legitimate Love, which is much the more ancient. For give me leave to tell ye, my dear Friend, it was but as it were of ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday's standing, or the day before, since young Boys began to strip and shew themselves naked in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places of Exercise, that this Frenzy getting in by degrees, and crowding in there, afterwards by little and little, being better fledg'd, and gathering strength of Wings in the Wrestling-Rings, the Insolence of it could never since be so restrain'd, but that still it will be afronting and adulterating that same Nuptial and Conjugal Love which is the Coadjutrix of Nature, and helps to immortallize mortal Mankind, which being extinguish'd by Death, it raises up, and immediately restores again by Generation. But this same <hi>Protogenes</hi> denies there is any Pleasure in Male Concupiscence, for he is asham'd and afraid to acknowledge it. Therefore there must be some decent Pretence for the feeling and handling these adult and lovely Youths. And truly he has found out a very clever Excuse, alledging it to be for the Sake of Friendship and Vertue. Therefore he rowls himself in the Dust, washes with cold Water, erects his Brows, and outwardly pretends to Philosophy and Chastity, for fear of the Law; but when Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness covers the Earth, and that all People have betaken themselves to their Rest,
<q>
                        <l>Fearless he steals to his belov'd delight,</l>
                        <l>And sweetly tasts th'autumnal Fruit all Night.</l>
                     </q> Now if it were as <hi>Protogenes</hi> says, that no Carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction attended these Masculine Familiarities, how can it be Love, when <hi>Venus</hi> is absent? Seeing that of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46327:158"/> all the Goddesses, she it is that <hi>Cupid</hi> is bound to obey and attend, and that he has no Honour or Power, but what she confers upon him? But if there be a sort of Love without Love, as a Man may be drunk without Wine, by drinking the Decoctions of Figs or Barley, the Disturbance of such a Love must prove fruitless, and to no end, and consequently loathsome and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive.</p>
                  <p>These things thus said, it was apparent that <hi>Pisia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> found himself touch'd to the Quick, and was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for what <hi>Daphnaeus</hi> had spoken. But after he had been silent a while, <hi>O</hi> Hercules, said he, <hi>what a strange Impudence and Levity is this in Men, to acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ty'd to Women by their generating Parts, like Dogs to Bitches; by this means expelling and banishing Love from the Places of Exercise, from the publick Portico's, and from conversing under the open Sky and Sun-shine, to the Snares, Poniards, Philters, and Sorceries of Lascivious Women; for it is not convenient for the Chast, either to love, or to be belov'd.</hi> At which Words, as my Father told me, he took <hi>Protogenes</hi> by the Hand, and repeated to him these Verses:
<q>
                        <l>Words, such as these, the <hi>Spartan</hi> Courage warm;</l>
                        <l>And the affronted Youth provoke to arm.</l>
                     </q> For surely the Exorbitant Language of <hi>Pisias</hi> gives us good reason to take <hi>Daphnaeus</hi>'s part, while he introduces over the Head of Wedlock, a Society void of Love, and utterly a Stranger to that same Friendship which descends, and is inspir'd from above; which if real Affection and Submission be wanting, can hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straind by all the Curbs and Yokes of Shame and Fear. Then <hi>Pisias,</hi> for my part, said he, I give little heed to this Argument; for as for <hi>Daphnaeus,</hi> I find him in the same Condition with Brass; for as Brass is not so easily
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46327:158"/> melted by the Fire, as by the force of the same melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and liquid Metal being powr'd upon it, which molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies both alike, and causes them to run and mix toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so it is not the Beauty of <hi>Lysandra</hi> that inflames him, but the Conversing long with her that is already inflam'd and full of Fire, that sets him all in a Flame himself; and it is apparent, that unless he makes hast to us, he will suddainly be melted with his own Heat. But I perceive, said he, the same thing will befall me, which <hi>Athemion</hi> has most reason to desire, that I shall offend both my Judges and my self; and therefore I shall say no more. Then <hi>Anthemion,</hi> 'tis very true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, your Fear is just; for you ought at the first to have spoken to the purpose, and what was proper to the Argument in Hand. To this <hi>Pisias</hi> reply'd, that he was willing that every Woman should have her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but withal, that it very much concern'd <hi>Baccho</hi> to have a care how he entangl'd himself in <hi>Ismenodora</hi>'s Wealth; least while we match him with so much Grandeur and Magnificence, we consume him to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, like Tin among Brass. For I must tell you, it would be a hard matter for so young a Stripling as he is, though he should marry a plain and ordinary Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to keep the Soveraignty of the Breeches, and to be still predominant, as Wine above Water. But we see her already design Superiority and Command; else why should she refuse so many Sutors of great Wealth and Noble Extraction that court her daily, to woe her self a meer Boy, that has but newly assum'd the Robes of Manhood, and more fit to go to School then to Marry. And therefore those Husbands that are wise, without any Admonition, out of their own Fore-sight, clip their Wives Wings themselves; that is, they prune away their Riches, that prompt them to Luxury and Vanity, and render them inconstant and Foolish; so that many times, by the help of these Wings, they soar out of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46327:159"/> their Husbands Reach and fly quite away; or if they stay at Home, better it were for a Man to be chain'd with Fetters of Gold, as they chain their Prisoners in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> then to be ty'd to the Riches of a Wife. However, said <hi>Protogenes,</hi> he has not hinted to us in the least, the hazard we run of inverting absurdly and ridiculously the Counsel of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> whose Words are these;
<q>
                        <l>For Wedlock ripe, look out, and choose thy Love;</l>

                        <l>Tarry too long, if they for Off-spring Marry.</l>
                        <l>Virgins of fourteen Signs of Ripeness shew,</l>
                        <l>At fifteen match 'em, e're more harm they know.</l>
                     </q> We, quite contrary to this Precept, are going about to couple a young Lad, scarce ripe for Marriage, to a Lady much older then himself, like those that graft the tender Scions of Dates and Fig-trees upon old Stocks, to make them bear Fruit before their Season. But you'l say, the Woman is in Love up to the Ears, and burns with Desire. Who is he that will hinder her from Masquerading before his Doors? from singing her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Lamentations at his Windows? from adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Statues with Chaplets and Garlands of Flowers? from duelling her Rivals, and winning him from them all by Feats of Arms? for these are Acts that demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the height of a passionate Affection. Let her knit her Brows, refrain all manner of Pomp and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; let her put on a Garb and Countenance suitable to such a violent Passion. But if Bashful and Modest, let her sit at Home, expecting her Suitors and Gallants to come and court her there. But who would not fly and abominate a Woman that professes Love, for fear of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46327:159"/> making such an impudent Incontinence the first step to his future Nuptials.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Protogenes</hi> had thus concluded, Do you not see, <hi>Anthemion,</hi> said <hi>Daphnaeus,</hi> how they make this again the common Hypothesis and Subject of Dispute, enforcing us still to continue our Discourse of Nuptial Love, who deny not our selves to be the Upholders of it; nor ever avoided the being one of that celebrated Chorus. Most certainly I do, reply'd <hi>Anthemion,</hi> and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Defence of Conjugal Affection; and let us have also your Assistance in maintaining the Argument about Riches, with which <hi>Pisias</hi> chiefly seems to scare us. 'Tis the least we can do, said my Father, for would it not be a great Reproach to Woman-kind, should we reject <hi>Ismenodora,</hi> because she is in Love, and wealthy to boot? But she is Nobly descended as well as Rich; what then, is she not beautiful and young? What if she be somewhat stately and haughty, by reason of her Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Birth, so she live in Esteem and Reputation. If she be proud and reserv'd to others, a sober and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Lady, as <hi>Ismenodora</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, will not be so to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. For there is nothing of Crabbedness, nothing sowre, nothing troublesome in Women truly Chast and Modest. So that if there be any Women that value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon their Chastity, and domineer over their Husbands for only that good Quality, 'tis because they are otherwise naturally morose, and that ill Quality gains them the Name of Shrews and Furies, to be commended for their Chastity and nothing else. But you'l say, since it may be a Man's Misfortune to be so hamper'd, would it not be better to marry some <hi>Thra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But as those great Men, through their Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Effeminacy, became a Prey to those Women; so on the other side, Men of low and mean Condition, having marry'd Women both wealthy and of splendid
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46327:160"/> Extraction, neither loar'd Sail, nor abated any thing of their Courage and Greatness of Mind, but liv'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, always honouring their Wives, and keeping that Superiority over them which was their Right and Due. But he that contracts and reduces his Wife within a narrow Compass, and makes her less, like a Ring that is too big for the Finger, to prevent it from dropping off, are like to those that dock off their Mares Tails, and clip their Mains, and then lead them to a River or Pond; for it is reported, that when those Mares perceive themselves so ill favour'dly shorn and disfigur'd, they loose their natural Courage, and will afterwards suffer themselves to be cover'd by Asses. And therefore as it is a base thing to prefer the Riches of a Woman above her Vertue or Nobility; so is it as great a Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reject Wealth when accompany'd with Vertue and illustrious Parentage. <hi>Antigonus</hi> writing to a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his, whom he had order'd to fortifie the little Hill <hi>Munichia,</hi> joyning the City of <hi>Athens</hi> to the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, bid him not only make the Collar strong, but keep the Dog lean; intimating thereby, that he should take care to impoverish the <hi>Athenians.</hi> But there is no necessity for the Husband of a rich and beautiful Wife, to make her poor, or to disfigure her, but by his Reserv'dness and Prudence, and by seeming not to admire any thing particularly in her, to carry himself so, that she may perceive that as he designs not to be a Tyrant; so she must not expect him to be her Subject, giving that Weight to the Ballance, that still the Scale may turn for the Good of both. Now, as for <hi>Isme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodora,</hi> her Years are fit for Marriage, and she is a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man most likely to bear Children; nay, I am inform'd that she is now in her Prime, and then smiling upon <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> for, said he, she is not elder then any of her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals; neither has she any grey Hairs, as some that keep Company with <hi>Baccho.</hi> Now if those People
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46327:161"/> think their Converse with the young Gentleman no way mis-becoming their Gravity; what hinders, but that she may affect and cherish him as well, if not better then any young Virgin whatever. For I must needs say, 'tis a difficult matter many times rightly to mix and blend the Tempers and Conditions of young People; in regard it will require some time to make them sensible of several Extravagancies which they may commit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they have lay'd aside the Pride and Wantonness which is incident to Youth, and many a blustring Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest will happen between the new married Couple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be brought to endure the Yoak, and draw quietly together; more especially if there be any thing of Jealousie harbour'd in the Bosom of either; for that, like the Wind, in the Absence of the Pilot, disturbs and confuses the Happiness of the Match, while the one has not skill to govern, and the other refuses to be govern'd. Now then if it be so that Nurses are sought for to look after sucking Infants, School-masters to teach Children; if Masters of Exercise guide young Striplings; if the Law and the Captain General governs those that are of age, so that no Man can be said to be at his own Liberty, to do what he list, where is the Absurdity for a Wife that has Wit and Discretion, and the Advantage of years, to govern and direct the Life and Conversation of a youthful Husband; profitable to him, as exceeding him in Wisdom, and augmenting the Pleasure of her Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the Sweetness of her Disposition, and Reality of Affection. To conclude, said he, we that are <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> our selves, ought to reverence <hi>Hercules,</hi> and not to be offended with those that marry Women elder then themselves; knowing, as wo do, that even <hi>Hercules</hi> himself gave his own Wife <hi>Megara,</hi> being then three and thirty years old, to <hi>Iolaus</hi> his Son, being no more then sixteen years of Age.</p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:46327:161"/>
                  <p>While they were in the midst of these Discourses, one of <hi>Pisias</hi>'s Companions and Friends, as my Father reported, came galloping toward them out of the City, whip and spur, to bring the News of a strange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Accident. For <hi>Ismenodora</hi> believing that <hi>Baccho</hi> no way dislik'd his being marry'd to her, but only was deterr'd by the Importunities of his Friends that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him from the Match, resolv'd not to let the young Man escape her. To this purpose she sent for certain Sparks of her acquaintance, whom she knew to be stout and resolute young Gentlemen, and some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were well Willers to her Amours, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Hour that <hi>Baccho</hi> was wont to pass by her House to the Wrestling Place, well attended and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently garbated, one day when he came near the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Door, anointed as he was for the Exercise, with two or three more in the same Posture, she met him in the Street, and gave a little Twitch to his upper Coat, which was the Signal given; at what time her Friends rusht forth, and fairly and softly catching him up in his Mandillion and Doublet, in a Huddle together, they carry'd him into the House, and lock'd the Doors fast after them. Then came the Women also, and pulling off his Mandillion, threw about him a costly Nuptial Garment. The Servants likewise running up and down from one Place to another, adorn'd the Posts not only of <hi>Ismenodora</hi>'s, but of <hi>Bacco</hi>'s House, with Laurel Boughs; and a Minstrel likewise was order'd to pipe along the Streets, as is usual at Weddings. The Story thus related, the <hi>Thespians</hi> and Strangers some of them laugh'd, some others were heinously offended, and did what they could to exasperate the Presidents of the Publick Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises. For they have a great Command over the young Gentlemen, and keep a severe and vigilant Eye over all their Actions. And now there was not a Word said of the Sports that were intended; but all the People for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46327:162"/> the Theatre, flock'd to <hi>Ism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nodora</hi>'s House, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing and debating the Matter one among another. But when <hi>Pisias</hi>'s Friend, with his Horse all foaming, and in a Sweat, as he had brought Intelligence from the Army in time of War, had deliver'd his News, hardly able to speak for want of Breath, and concluded his Story with saying, <hi>That</hi> Ismenodora <hi>had ravish'd</hi> Baccho, my Father told me, that <hi>Zeuxippus</hi> fell a laughing, and as he was a great Admirer of that Poet, repeated the Verses of <hi>Euripides,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Wanton with Wealth, fair Lady, thou hast done</l>
                        <l>No more then Wisdom teaches every one.</l>
                     </q> But that <hi>Pisias</hi> starting up out of his Seat, made a great Exclamation, crying out; O ye Gods! when will ye put an end to this Licentiousness, that will in the end subvert our City? For now all things are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into disorder through Violation of the Laws; but perhaps it is now look'd upon as a slight matter to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress the Law and violate Justice; for even the Law of Nature is transgress'd and broken by the insolent Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the Female Sex. Was ever there any such thing committed in the Island of <hi>Lemnos?</hi> Let us go, said he, let us go and deliver up the Wrestling Place, and the Council House to the Women, if the City be so effeminate as to put up these Indignities. Thus <hi>Pisias</hi> brake from the Company in a Fury; nor would <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togenes</hi> leave him, partly offended at what had happen'd, partly to asswage and mollifie his Friend. But <hi>Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion,</hi> 'twas a Juvenile bold Attempt, said he, and truly <hi>Lemnian,</hi> for we know that the Lady was warmly in Love. To whom <hi>Soclarus</hi> smiling, Do you then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, said he, that this was a real Ravishment and Force, and not rather a Stratagem of the young Man's own Contrivance (for he has Wit at will) to the end
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46327:162"/> he might escape out of the Hands of his ruder Male Lovers, into the Embraces of a fair and rich Widow? Never say so, said <hi>Anthemion,</hi> nor have such a Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Baccho.</hi> For were he not naturally, as he is of a plain and open Temper, he would never have conceal'd this thing from me, to whom he has always imparted his Secrets, and whom he knew to be always a Favorer of <hi>Ismenodora</hi>'s Design. For according to the saying of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> it is a harder matter to withstand Love then Anger. For whatever it has a Desire to, it will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase with the Hazard of Life, Fortune and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now where is there a more accomplish'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in all our City that <hi>Ismenodora?</hi> When did you ever hear an ill Word spoken of her? Or when did ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing done in her House, give the least Suspition of an ill Act? Rather we may say, that she seems to be inspir'd beyond other Women with something above Human Reason. Then <hi>Pemptides</hi> smiling, Truly, said he, there is a certain Disease of the Body, which they call <hi>Sacred:</hi> So that it is no wonder, if some Men give the Appellation of Sacred and Divine, to the most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and vehement Passion of the Mind. But as in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> once I saw two Neighbours hotly contending about a Serpent which crept before them in the Road, while both concluded it to be good Luck, and each assum'd the happy Omen to himself; so seeing some of you at this time haling Love into the Chambers of the Men, others into the Cabinets of the Women, as a Divinely transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good; I do not wonder, since it is a Passion so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and greatly esteem'd, that it be magnify'd, and held in greatest Veneration by those that have most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to clip its Wings, and expel and drive it from them. Hitherto therefore I have been silent, perceiving the Debate to be rather about a particular Concern, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for the Publick Good. But now that <hi>Pisias</hi> is gone, I would willingly understand from one of you,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:46327:163"/> upon what accompt it was, that they who first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of Love, were so fond to deify it? So soon as <hi>Pemptides</hi> had done, and that my Father was about to say something in answer to his Question, another Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger came from the City, in <hi>Ismenodora's</hi> name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing <hi>Anthemiom</hi> to come to her: for that the Tumult increased, and the Presidents of the Games could not agree, while one was of Opinion that <hi>Baccho</hi> was to be demaned and delivered up into their Hands, and the other thought it an Impertinence to meddle with that which nothing concern'd them.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Anthemion</hi> being gone, my Father address'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Pemptides</hi> by name, and so entring into the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing discourse, You seem to Me, Sir said he, to have hit upon a very strange and nice point, or rather as I may so say, to have endeavour'd to stir things which are not to be mov'd, in reference to the Opinion which we have of the Gods, while you demand a Reason and demonstration of every thing in particular. For it is sufficient to believe according to the Faith of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and the Instructions of the Country where we have been bred and born, then which we cannot utter or invent a more certain Argument,
<q>
                        <l>For surely all the Wit of human Brain,</l>
                        <l>This part of Knowledge never could attain.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this is a Foundation and Basis common to all Piety and Religion; of which if once the steady Rule and decreed Maxims be once disordered and shaken, all the rest must totter and become suspected. And no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but you have heard in what a confusion of thought <hi>Euripides</hi> was, and how it perplexed him to begin his <hi>Menalippe</hi>
                     <q>
                        <pb n="311" facs="tcp:46327:163"/>

                        <l>For 'tis by hearsay only what I know.</l>
                     </q> Where he seems to have a Confidence in the Lofty Stile and Elaborate Eloquence of his Tragedy, to venture the Indignation of the Deity; but finding he had drawn upon himself the Envy of another Adversary, the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he altered the Verse.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Jove, for we own he has received that Name</l>
                     <l>From Truth alone, and not from common Fame.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>What difference then is there between calling in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Name of <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Minerva,</hi> and doubting of the Name of <hi>Cupid,</hi> or <hi>Love?</hi> For it is not of late that <hi>Cupid</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> has challeng'd Altars and Sacrifices, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he a Foreigner started up out of any Barbarian Superstition as were the <hi>Attae,</hi> and the <hi>Adonaei,</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by I know not what sort of <hi>Hermophrodites</hi> and idle Women. Nor has he clandestinly crept into Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors no way becoming him to avoid the accusation of Bastardy, and being unduly enroll'd in the Catalogue of the Gods. But when you hear <hi>Empedocles</hi> thus saying,
<q>
                        <l>In Friendship too, observe my Song,</l>
                        <l>There is both equal Broad and Long:</l>
                        <l>But this thou must not think to find</l>
                        <l>With Eyes of Body but of Mind.</l>
                     </q> You ought to believe all this to be said of Love. For that Love, no more then any of the rest of the ancient Deities, is visible, but apprehended only by Opinion and Belief. For every one of which if you require a reason and demonstrative Argument, by enquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46327:164"/> every Temple, and making a Sophistical doubt upon every Altar, you shall find nothing free from Calumny and malicious Slander. For that I may go on farther, observe but these.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>I do not <hi>Venus</hi> see with Mortal Eyes,</l>
                     <l>The Goddess unto whom we Sacrifice;</l>
                     <l>Yet this is she that mighty <hi>Cupid</hi> bare</l>
                     <l>Whose off-spring all Terrestrial Beings are.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Empedocles</hi> gives her the Epithite of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or <hi>Fruitful:</hi> both very aptly and pertinently. For indeed the great and wonderful Work of generation is properly the Work of <hi>Venus,</hi> where Love is only an Assistant, when present with <hi>Venus:</hi> but whose absence renders the act it self altogether irksom, dishonourable, harsh and ungrateful. For the Conjunction of Man and Woman without true Affection, like hunger and thirst, that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in Satiety, produces nothing truly noble or commendable, unless the Goddess seperating from Love the glut of Pleasure, perpetuate Delight by a continual supply of friendship and harmony of Temper. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Parmenides</hi> asserts Love to be the most ancient of all the Works of <hi>Venus,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Of all the Gods that rule above</l>
                        <l>She first brought forth the mighty Love.</l>
                     </q> But <hi>Hesiod,</hi> in my Opinion, seems more Philosophically to make <hi>Love</hi> the Eldest of all the Gods, as from whom all the other Deities derive their beginning. Therefore should we deprive <hi>Love</hi> of the Honours which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed him, neither will the Ceremonies ascrib'd to <hi>Venus</hi> be any longer in request. For it is not sufficient to say, that some Men reproach Love and load him with
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46327:164"/> Contumelies, but abstain from giving her an ill word. For upon the same Theater we hear these Scandals fix'd upon both;

                     </gap>, which signifies to Murder and destroy: thereby affording an occasion for some to give the Name of <hi>Ares</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> to that same proneness and perverse Inclination in Men to wrath and Passion, and to quarrel and fight one with another. Others affirm <hi>Venus</hi> to be nothing but our Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence: that <hi>Mercury</hi> is no more then the faculty of Speech, that the <hi>Muses</hi> are only the Names for the

And thus you see into what an Abyss of Atheism we are likely to plunge our selves, while we go about to set up the Passions, Faculties and Vertues of Men for so many Gods. I plainly perceive it, reply'd <hi>Pemptides;</hi> for I neither believe it lawful to make the Gods to be Passions, nor on the other side, to make the Passions to be Deities. To whom my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Well then, said he, do you believe <hi>Mars</hi> to be a God, or a Passion of ours? To which when <hi>Pemptides</hi> reply'd, that he thought <hi>Mars</hi> to be the Deity that rectify'd the Angry and Couragious part of Man; my Father presently retorting upon him, Why then, said he, shall our passionate Part, and those wrathful Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations within us that provoke us to mischief and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, have a Deity to over-rule and govern then, and will you not allow the same Guardianship over our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter propensities to Love, Friendship, Society and Peace? There is a Deity that presides and has the superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over those that kill and are slain; a Deity that bears rule in matters of Arms, all Warlike Preparations, Assaults of Citys, Depredations of Countries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And distributes rewards as he sees occasion; and shall there be no Deity to be a Witness and Overseer, a Supream Governour and Director of Conjugal Affection which terminates in Concord and happy Society? Nay we find that they who make it their sport to Hunt Wild Goats, Hares and Deer are not without their Forest Deity to incourage them; and they that make it their business to Trapan Wolves and Bears into Snares and Pit-falls, Pray for good luck to <hi>Aristaeus,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Who first of all for the Wild Beasts of Prey</l>
                        <l>With Gins and Snares in secret Ambush lay.</l>

                     <hi>Hercules</hi> having also bent his Bow, before he let fly at the Bird which he intended to hit, invok'd another Deity, as we find in <hi>Ecschylus;</hi>

                     </q> But for Men that Hunt the most Noble Game of Love and Friendship, there is not so much as one <hi>Daemon</hi> to assist and prosper so laudable an enterprise. Truly, <hi>Daphnaeus</hi> for my part I cannot believe a Man to be a more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Plant then an Oak, or Mulbury-Tree, or the Vine, which <hi>Homer</hi> calls by the Name of <hi>Hemeris;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that Man in his due season also is endu'd with a Powerful faculty to bud, and pleasantly put forth the Beautys both of his Body and Mind. To whom <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> In the Name of all the Gods, who ever thought otherwise? All those most certainly, reply'd my Father, who believing the care of Plowing, Sowing and Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is an Employment becoming the Gods: to which purpose they have also certain Nymphs attending them, who are call'd <hi>Druids,</hi> and live just as long as the Trees, of which they take care; Or as <hi>Pindarus</hi> Sings,
<q>
                        <l>God <hi>Bacchus,</hi> He</l>
                        <l>That is the Chast Autumnal Light,</l>
                        <l>Whose Influences warm and Bright</l>
                        <l>Give nourishment to every fruitful Tree.</l>
                     </q> And yet will not allow the nourishment and growth of Children and Young People, who in the flower of their Age are to be form'd and shap'd into several varieties of Beauty, to be under the care and tuition of any Deity: or that there is any Divinity to take care, that Man being once born may be guided and conducted in the true Paths of Vertue, and to prevent the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46327:166"/> Plant from being bow'd and bent the wrong way for want of a good Instructor, or by the deprav'd conversation of those with whom he lives. For my part, I look upon it as a heinous peice of Indignity and Ingratitude, and as it were a driving of the Deity from his love to Mankind, which he is ready to dispeirce and diffuse over all, and willingly never abandons the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses and necessitys of Mortals. Of which there are some that cannot be avoided, though not so pleasing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. Thus our being delivered from the Mothers Womb, is no such delightful thing, as being attended with Pain and Issues of Blood, and yet there is a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Midwife and Overseer that takes particular care of that necessity, which is <hi>Lucina.</hi> And indeed a Man had better never to be born, then to be made bad and wicked for want of a good Tutor and Guardian. Nay, we find that the divine Power does not desert us in our Sickness, nor after we are dead; there being still some Deity or other, who claims some certain peculiar Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment or Function, even upon those occasions. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest there is one that helps to convey the Souls of such as have ended this Life into the other World, and lays them asleep, like the Eunuch that is appointed to usher in the Bride into her <hi>Bed-Chamber;</hi> for which reason <hi>Mercury</hi> is called by the name of <gap reason="foreign">

There is nothing disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, nothing of forc'd necessity in this, but gentle perswasion and alluring Grace, rendring labour deghtful, as leading to Vertue and Friendship, and which never attains the true accomplishment of the end it aims at without some divine assistance; nor can have any other Conductor and Master then <hi>Cupid</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who is the Friend and Companion of the <hi>Mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>By the way, reply'd my Father, we may here take notice of what <hi>Plato</hi> discourses upon this Subjects. For he says, that there is a certain Madness transmitted from the Body to the Soul, proceeding from a malignant Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ill Humors, or a noxious Vapor, or rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Spirit that possesses the Heart; which Madness is a rugged and terrible Disease. The other is a kind of Fury, partaking something of Divine Inspiration; neither is it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender'd within, but is an Insufflation from without, and a disturbance of the Rational and Considerative Faculty, deriving its Beginning and Motion from some stronger Power; the common Affection of which is call'd an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick Passion. For as <gap reason="foreign">

Now the Prophetic Part of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> derives it self from the Inspiration of <hi>Apollo,</hi> possessing the Intellect of the Sooth-sayer; but <hi>Bacchanal</hi> Fury proceeds from Father <hi>Liber,</hi>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, in regard we measure the Excellency of a Deity by his Puissance, and the Benefit which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at his Hands, and esteem Power and Vertue to be the two chiefest and most Divine of all Human Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, it may not be unseasonable to consider, whether
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46327:168"/> Love be inferior in Power to any other of the Gods. For according to <hi>Sophocles,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Great is the Puissance of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Queen,</l>
                        <l>And great the Honour which her Triumphs win.</l>
                     </q> Great is also the Dominion of <hi>Mars,</hi> and indeed we see the Power of all the rest of the Gods, divided in some Measure into two sorts; the one familiarly alluring to Vertue and Honesty; the other, which consists in the Resistance of Evil, and which is originally bred in the Soul. As <hi>Plato</hi> observes in his Description of Forms.</p>
                  <p>Now then let us consider, that Venereal Delight is a thing that is purchas'd many times for a small matter of Money, and that there is no Man that ever underwent any Pain or Danger for the sake of Venereal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unless he were inflam'd and tormented with the burning Fires of an ardent Lust; insomuch, that not to mention such Curtesans as either <hi>Phryne</hi> or <hi>Lais,</hi> we find that the Harlot <hi>Gnathemon,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>By gloomy Lanthorn-Light, at Evening late,</l>
                        <l>Waiting and calling for some Triggermate,</l>
                     </q> Is often pass'd by and Neglected.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>But then if once some Spirit blew the Fire,</l>
                     <l>kindl'd by Love's extream and warm Desire,</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This makes the Pleasure equally esteem'd and valu'd to the Treasures of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> and all his vast Dominions. So faint and so soon cloy'd is Venereal Desire, unless rendred grateful by the Charms and Inspiration of Love. Which is more evidently confirm'd by this: for that many Men admit others to partake of their Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46327:169"/> Pleasures, prostituting not only their Mistresses and Concubines, but also their own Wives, to the Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Friends; as it is reported of the <hi>Roman Kalbas</hi> or <hi>Galba,</hi> who inviting <hi>Mecaenas</hi> to his House, and perceiving him winking and nodding upon his Wife, turn'd away his Head upon his Pillow, as if he had been asleep; yet at the same time, when one of the Servants came creeping out of the next Room, to steal a Bottle of Wine from the Cubboard, presently turning about, with his Eyes open, <hi>Varlet,</hi> said he, <hi>'tis only to pleasure</hi> Mecaenas, <hi>that I sleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Argos,</hi> there was a great Animosity between <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costratus</hi> and <hi>Faulius,</hi> so that they always oppos'd each other, and quarrel'd at the Council Board. Now it being known that King <hi>Philip</hi> intended a Visit to that City, <hi>Faulius</hi> bethought himself that he could not miss the highest Preferment the Government could afford, if he could but oblige the King with the Company of his Wife, who was both Beautiful and Young. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costratus</hi> smelling this Design, set some of his Servants to walk too and fro before <hi>Faulius</hi>'s House, and observe who went in and out; where they had not stay'd long, but out came <hi>Nicostratus</hi>'s Wife, in high Shoes, with a Mantle and Cap, after the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Fashion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couter'd like one of the Kings Pages, accompany'd by two or three more, that carry'd her directly to the Kings Court. Since then there ever were, and still are too many Lovers of this Temper, did you ever know of any one that ever prostituted his particular Male Friend, though it were to gain the Honours as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd to <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself? Truly, I never believe there ever was any such. For why? there never was any one that would pretend to oppose and contend with a Tyrant; but there are many Rivals and Competitors that will quarrel and fight for Boys that are Beautiful, and in the Prime of their Years. It is reported of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stogiton</hi>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:46327:169"/> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> and <hi>Menalippus</hi> of <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> that they never contested with Tyrants, though they wasted and ruin'd the Common-wealth, and indulg'd the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity of their Lust; but when they found them attempting their Male Amours, they withstood them with the utmost Peril of their Lives, as if they had been to defend their Temples, and their most Sacred Sanctuaries. <hi>Alexander</hi> also is said to have sent to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Proteus,</hi> in these Words: <hi>Send me that Musical Girl that Plays and Sings so well, and take ten Talents for her, unless thou lov'st her thy self.</hi> Another time, when one of his <hi>Minions, Antipatridas</hi> came to be jovial with him, and brought a Minstrel in his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to compleat their Mirth, the Prince being greatly affected with the Girls Playing and Singing, ask'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipatridas, Whether he had any extraordinary Kindness for her?</hi> Who answering, <hi>That he lov'd her as his Eyes. Then all the Plagues of Mankind light upon thee,</hi> quoth the Prince: however he would not so much as touch the Girl. Consider also what vast Power Love has also over Martial Men and Warriors. Not as <hi>Euripides</hi> will have it to be,
<q>
                        <l>Not slothful, neither out of Womens Fear</l>
                        <l>Still shifting from the dang'rous Toils of War.</l>
                     </q> For a Man that is once inflam'd with Love, wants not <hi>Mars</hi> himself to be his Second, when he is to engage with his Enemies; but confiding in the Deity that is within him,
<q>
                        <l>Ventures through Fire and Seas, and blustring Storms,</l>
                        <l>While Love of Friend his daring Courage warms.</l>
                     </q> And breaks through all Opposition, if his Mistriss re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any Proof of his Valour. Therefore we read in

                     <hi>Sophecles,</hi> that the Daughters of <hi>Niobe</hi> being wounded with Arrows to Death, one of them, as she lay wollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Blood, calls out for no other Help or Succor to assist her in her Revenge, but her Love.</p>

                     <l>Where is my Love? she cry'd,</l>

                  <p>You know the Reason why <hi>Cleomachus</hi> the <hi>Pharsalian,</hi> fell in Battel. <hi>I am a Stranger to the Story,</hi> reply'd <hi>Pemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides, and would willingly therefore hear it.

                  <p>In the heat of the War between the <hi>Chalcidians</hi> and the <hi>Eretrians, Cleomachus</hi> went to aid the <hi>Chalcidians;</hi> at what time it was evident that the <hi>Chalcidians</hi> were the stronger in Foot, but they found it a difficult thing to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Force of the Enemies Horse. Thereupon they requested <hi>Cleomachus,</hi> being their Confederate, and a Man signaliz'd for his Courage, to give the first On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set upon the Enemies Cavalry. Presently the Youth, whom he most intirely lov'd, being present, he ask'd him, <hi>Whether he would stay and be a Spectator of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat?</hi> To which, when the Lad gave his Consent, and after many tender Kisses and Embraces, had put on his Helmet, <hi>Cleomachus,</hi> his Love redoubling his Courage, and being surrounded with some few of the Flower of the <hi>Thessalian</hi> Horse, charg'd into the thickest of the Enemy, and put them to the Rout; which the heavy-arm'd Infantry seeing, betook themselves also to Flight, so that the <hi>Chalcidians</hi> obtain'd a Noble Victory; however <hi>Cleomachus</hi> was there slain, and the <hi>Chalcidians</hi> shew his Monument erected in the Market Place with a fair Pillar standing upon it to this Day; and whereas they abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Pederastie</hi> before, after that, they admir'd and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46327:170"/> affected it above all other Pleasures. Nevertheless, <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, that <hi>Cleomachus</hi> indeed lost his Life after the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Battel which he gain'd from the <hi>Eretrians;</hi> but as for that <hi>Cleomachus,</hi> who was thus kiss'd by his Male Concubine, he was of <hi>Chalcis</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and sent to aid the <hi>Chalcidians</hi> in <hi>Euboea.</hi> Which is the reason of that same <hi>Ballad</hi> which is generally sung among them:
<q>

For Men will desert those of the same Tribe or Family; nay, before <hi>George,</hi> their very Children and Parents; but never any Enemy could pierce or penetrate between a Lover and his Darling Minion, in whose Sight, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, when there is no necessity, the Lover delights to shew his Courage and Contempt of Danger; like <hi>Thero</hi> the <hi>Thessalian,</hi> who clapping his Left hand to the Wall, and then drawing his Sword, struck of his Thumb, thereby challenging his Rival to do the same.

                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:46327:171"/> that doating upon <hi>Admetus,</hi> he became his Servant for a whole year. And here methinks we have very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely mention'd <hi>Althestis:</hi> For although the Temper of Women has little to do with <hi>Mars,</hi> love many times drives them to daring Attempts beyond their own Nature, even to lay violent Hands upon themselves. And if there be any Credit to be given to the Fables of the Poets, the Stories of <hi>Alcestis, Protesilaus</hi> and <hi>Euridice,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> plainly evince us, that <hi>Pluto</hi> himself obeys no other God but Love. For as <hi>Sophocles</hi> says,
<q>
                        <l>To others, be their Fame or Birth whate're,</l>
                        <l>Nor Equity, nor Favour will he show;</l>

                        <l>His downright Justice only makes them know.</l>
                     </q> But to Lovers he pays a Reverence; to them alone, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implacable nor inexorable. And therefore it is a very good thing to be initiated into the <hi>Eleusinian</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; but I find the Condition of those much better in Hell, who are admitted into the Mysteries of Love; which I speak, as one that neither altogether confide in Fables, nor altogether mis-believe them. For they speak a great deal of Sence, and many times by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Kind of Divine good Hap, hit upon the Truth, when they say that Lovers are permitted to return from Hell to Sun-light again; but which way, and how, they know not; as wandring from the right Path, which <hi>Plato,</hi> first of all Men, by the Assistance of Phylosophy, found out. For there are several slender and obscure dimanations of Truth dispiers'd among the Mythologies of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> only they want an acute and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Tracer, to find out greater Mysteries by hunting small things <hi>Dryfoot.</hi> And therefore let 'em go.</p>
                  <p>And now since we find the Power of Love to be so great, let us take a little Notice of that which we call the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46327:172"/> Benevolence and Favour of it toward Men. Not whither it confers many Benefits upon those that are addicted to it, for that's a thing apparent to all Men; but whether the Blessings that Men receive by it, are more and greater then any other. And here <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> notwithstanding that he was a Person so amorous as he was, admires the meanest gift it has; for says he,
<q>
                        <l>Love into Men Poetic fire infuses,</l>
                        <l>Though ne're before acquainted with the Muses.</l>
                     </q> For he might as well have said, that Love makes a Man wise and Prudent, that was a Fool and sottish before; or a Coward bold and daring; or a Stout and couragious Man a dastard and pusillanimous; as when we heat Wooden Poles in the fire of soft and bend 'em to make them strong and streight. In like manner he that was a sordid Miser before, falling once in Love, becomes liberal and lofty minded; his covetous and pinching humor being mollified by Love, like Iron in the Fire, so that he is more pleas'd with being liberal to the Objects of his Love, then before delighted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from others. For ye all know how <hi>Anytus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Anthemion</hi> fell in Love with <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> who understanding that <hi>Anytus</hi> had invited several of his Friends to a noble and splendid Banquet, came into the Room in Masquerade, and going to the Table, after he had taken one half of the Silver Cups and other Plate, went his way. Which when some of the Guests took very ill, and told <hi>Anytus</hi> that the young Lad had demeaned himself very rudely and saucily. Not so, said <hi>Anytus,</hi> but very civily, since when it was in his power to have taken all the rest, he was so civil as to leave me some. Pleased with this story, <hi>O Hercules, quo Zeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xippus,</hi> how have ye almost ras'd out of my Mind, that Hereditary Hatred which I had conceiv'd against <hi>Anytus,</hi>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:46327:172"/> for his ill opinion of <hi>Socrates</hi> and Philosophy, since he was become so gentle and generous in his Amours. Be it so said my Father, but let us proceed, Love is of that nature, that it renders those that were severe and morose before, both affable and pleasant in their Humor. For as,
<q>
                        <l>The burning Tapers make the House more light,</l>
                        <l>And all things look more glorious to the sight,</l>
                     </q> So the Heat of Love renders the Soul of Man more lively and cheerful. But there are many who go quite contrary to reason in this particular. For when they behold a glitttering Light in a House by Night they admire, and look upon it as something Celestial; but when they see a narrow pittiful, abject soul, of a suddain replenish'd with Understanding, Generosity, Sence of Honour, Curtesie and Liberality, they do not believe themselves constrain'd to say as <hi>Telemachus</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi>
                     <q>Surely some God within this House resides.</q> For the love of the Graces tell me, said <hi>Daphnaeus,</hi> is it not a thing altogether as much savouring of Divinity, that a Man who contemns all other things, not only his Friends and Familiar acquaintance, but also the Laws, the Magistrates; even Kings, and Princes themselves; who fears nothing, is astonish'd at nothing, cares for nothing, but thinks himself able to fight an Army, so soon as he beholds the object of his burning Love,
<q>
                        <l>As dunghil Cravens, and with suddain Blow,</l>
                        <l>Hang their loose Wings with little list to Crow,</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:46327:173"/> Should presently loose all his prowess, and that all his Bravery should fail him as if his heart were quite sunk to the bottom of his Belly? Remarkable therefore is that recorded by <hi>Sapho</hi> among the <hi>Muses.</hi> For the <hi>Romans</hi> report in their Storys, that <hi>Cacus</hi> the Son of <hi>Vulcan</hi> vomited Fire and Flames out of his Mouth. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Sapho</hi> speaks, as if her words were mixt with fire, and by her Verses plainly discovers the violent heat of her Heart,
<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>
                              <hi>According to that of</hi> Philoxenus,</l>
                        </lg>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Seeking for Cure of Love-inflicted wounds</l>
                           <l>From Pleasing Numbers and Melodious sounds.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> And here, <hi>Daphnaeus,</hi> if the Love of <hi>Lysander,</hi> have not buried in oblivion your former sportive of Dalliances, I would desire ye to call to mind and oblige us with the repetition of those Elegant Raptures of <hi>Sappho,</hi> wherein she tells us, how that when the Person beloved by her appear'd, her speech forsook her, her Body was all over in a cold Sweat; how she grew pale and wan, and was surpriz'd with a suddain trembling and diziness. To this <hi>Daphnaeus</hi> consented, and so soon as he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, said my Father, So <hi>Jupiter</hi> help me, is not this an apparent seisure of something more then human up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul? Can this be other then some Celestial rapture of the Mind? what do we find equal to it in the <hi>Pythian</hi> Prophetess, when she sits upon the <hi>Tripos?</hi> Where do we find that the Flutes which are used in the <hi>Bacchanalian Orgies,</hi> or the Tabors play'd upon in the Ceremonies of the Mother of the Gods, rouse up such noble Transports among that fanatic sort of Enthusiasts? Many there are that behold the same Body and the same Beauty, but the Lover only admires and is ravish'd with it. And what's the reason d' ye think! For we
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46327:173"/> do not perceive ot understand it, when <hi>Menander</hi> shews it us;
<q>
                        <l>'Tis the Occasion that infects the Heart,</l>
                        <l>For only he that's wounded feels the Smart.</l>
                     </q> Now 'tis the God of Love that gives the Occasion, seizing upon some, and letting others go free. What therefore had been more seasonable for me to have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, since it is now chop'd into my Mouth, as <hi>Aeschilus</hi> says, I think it is my best way to let it go, as being a Matter of great Importance. For it may be, my dear Friend, there is not any thing in the World which was not perceptible by Sence; but what gain'd Credit and Authority at the first, either from Fables, or from the Law, or else from rational Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. And therefore Poets, Law-givers, and in the third place, Philosophers, were all along the first that instructed and confirm'd us in our Opinions of the Gods. For all agree that there are Gods; but concerning their Number, their Order, their Essence and Power, they vastly differ one among another. For the Philosophers Deities are subject neither to Age nor Diseases, neither do undergo any Labour or Pain,
<q>
                        <l>Exempted from the Noise and Hurry,</l>
                        <l>Of busie <hi>Acherontic</hi> Ferry.</l>
                     </q> And therefore they will not admit the Poetical <hi>Erides</hi> and <hi>Litai,</hi> or <hi>Numen's</hi> of <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Pacification;</hi> nor will they acknowledge Fear and Terror to be the Sons of <hi>Mars.</hi> They also differ from the Law-givers in many things. Thus <hi>Zenophanes</hi> forbid the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to worship <hi>Osiris</hi> as a God, if they thought him to be Mortal, and if they thought him to be a God, not to bewail him. Then again, the Poets and Law-givers vary from the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46327:174"/> and will not so much as hear them, while they Deifie certain Idea's, Numbers, Unites, and Spirits; such is the wild Variety, and vast Difference of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among these sort of People. Therefore as there were at <hi>Athens</hi> the three Factions of the <hi>Parati, Epacri,</hi> and <hi>Pediei,</hi> that could never agree, but were always at variance one with another; yet when they were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd, gave their Suffrages unanimously for <hi>Solon,</hi> and chose him with one Consent for their Peace-maker, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and Law-giver, as to whom the highest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Vertue was beyond all doubt or question due; so the three different Sects or Factions, in reference to the Gods, in giving their Opinions, some for one, and some for another, as being by no means willing to subscribe one to another, are all positive in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as to the God of Love: Him, the most famous of the Philosopers, and the numerous Acclamations of the Philosophers and Law-givers have enroll'd in the Catalogue of the Gods, with loud Praises and Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. And as <hi>Alcaeus</hi> says, that the <hi>Mitylenians</hi> unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously chose <hi>Pittacus</hi> for their Prince; so <hi>Hesiod, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> bring forth <hi>Cupid</hi> out of <hi>Helicon,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him in Pomp and State into the Academy to be our King, Governour, and Director, hamper'd with all the Yokes and Fetters of Friendship and Society; not as <hi>Euripides</hi> says.</p>
                  <p>With Fetters bound, but not of Brass, God knows, as if the Bonds of Love were only the cold and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Chains of Necessity, made use of as a colorable Pretence to excuse and qualifie Shame; and not such as are carryed upon winged Chariots to the most lovely and Celestial Objects in this World, concerning which, there has been much more said by others.</p>
                  <p>After my Father had thus deliver'd himself; Do ye not perceive, said <hi>Soclarus,</hi> how, being fallen a second time into the same Matter, you have as it were by force
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46327:174"/> constrain'd your self to this Deviation, unjustly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us, if I may speak what I think, of that same Sacred Discourse which you were entring into? For as before, you gave us a Hint concerning <hi>Plato</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but pass'd them over as if it had been done against your Will, so you do now again. 'Tis true, that as for those things which <hi>Plato,</hi> or rather the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> have deliver'd in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Writings, I do not believe you would put your self to the trouble to say any thing more, although we should request it. But whereas you have obscurly hinted that the Fables of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> accord with <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion concernig Love, we know you have a greater Kindness for us then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal your Knowledge from us; and though it be but a little of those imports <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t Matters; it shall suffice us. Thereupon the rest of the Company declaring their Readiness to give attention, my Father thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> said he, as also the <hi>Grecians,</hi> set up two Deities of Love; the one Vulgar, the other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial; to which they add a third, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be the Sun; and as for <hi>Venus,</hi> they pay her a very great Veneration. We our selves also do find that there is a great Affinity and Resemblance between the Sun and the God of Love. For neither of them are material Fire, as some conjecture. All that we can acknowledge is only this, that there is a certain soft and generative Heat and Warmth proceeding from the Sun, which affords to the Body Nourishment, Light and Relaxation of Cold: Whereas that Warmth which comes from the other, works the same Effects in the Soul. And as the Sun breaking forth from the Clouds, and after a thick Fog is much hotter; so Love, after the Passionate Anger and Jealousies of the Party belov'd, upon Reconciliation of both Parties, are over, grows more delightful and fervent. Moreover as some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46327:175"/> the Sun to be kindl'd and extinguish'd, they also imagine the same things concerning Love, as being mortal and unstable. For neither can a Constitution, not enur'd to Exercise, endure the Sun, nor the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of an illiterate and ill tutor'd Soul, brook Love without Trouble and Pain, and both are alike distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd and diseas'd, for which the lay the Blame upon the Power of Love, and not their own Weakness. Herein only there may seem to be some Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, for that the Sun displays to the Sight upon the Earth, both Beauty and Deformity at once. But Love is a Luminary that affords us the View of beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Objects only, and perswades Lovers to cast their Eyes only upon what is pleasing and delightful; but with a careless Eye to overlook all other things. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, they that attribute the Name of <hi>Venus</hi> to the Earth, can make out no Resemblance at all. For that <hi>Venus</hi> is Celestial and Divine; but the Region of Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between Mortal and Immortal, is weak of it self, obscure and dark, without the Presence of the Sun; as <hi>Venus</hi> is where Love is absent. Therefore more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with more probability, the Moon is liken'd to <hi>Venus,</hi> and the Sun to Love, rather then to any other of the Gods. Nevertheless, we must not therefore say they are all one. For neither is the Soul and Body the same, but distinct; as the Sun is visible, Love perceptible on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Sence. And if it might not be thought too harsh a Saying, a Man might affirm, that the Sun and Love act contrary to one another. For the Sun diverts the Understanding from things intelligible to sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, alluring and fascinating the Sight with the Grace and Splendor of his Rays, and perswading us to search among other things, even for Truth it self, within and about himself, and no where else. And we appear to be passionately in Love with this Sun, because as <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> says,
<q>
                        <pb n="335" facs="tcp:46327:175"/>
                        <l>He always on the Earth displays,</l>
                        <l>The Glory of his burning Rays,</l>
                     </q> For want of our Knowledge of another Life; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through Forgetfulness of those things, which Love calls to our Remembrance. For as when after being newly awaked, and coming into a bright and dazling Light, we forget whatever appear'd to the Soul in our Dreams; so the Sun seems to stupifie the Remembrance of things done, and happening in this Life, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate and empoyson the Understanding, with the Pleasure and Admiration of himself, so that we forget all other Considerations besides of the other Life. Though there indeed are the real Substances proper for the Contemplation of the Soul; here they only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Dreams, and grope after what is beautiful and Divine;
<q>
                        <l>Fallacious Dreams about his Temples flew,</l>
                        <l>But such as charm'd his Fancy, though untrue.</l>
                     </q> Being perswaded here, that every thing is goodly and highly to be priz'd, unless they happen upon some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and chast Love to be their Physitian and Preserver; which being transmitted from <hi>Elysium</hi> through Corporeal Bodies, leads them to Truth, and the Fields of Verity; where they desire to embrace that which is pure, and void of Fallacy and Sophistication, and for some time to abide in Amity together; while Love, like an obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious Servitor to those that are initiated in Sacred Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, assists and leads them to Noble Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but no sooner is Love sent from hence again, but the Soul is no longer able to make her approaches of her self, but by the Body. And therefore as <hi>Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when Children are not able of themselves to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46327:176"/> the intelligible Ideas of incorporeal and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Substances, form and set before their Eyes the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible and visible Imitations of <hi>Spheres, Cubes,</hi> and <hi>Dode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caedrons:</hi> In like manner Celestial Love having fram'd lovely Mirrors to represent lovely Objects, though mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and passive Figures of things divine, and only percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to Sence, shews them to us glittering in the Form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, Colours and Shape of Youth in its Prime, and first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly moves the Memory inflam'd by the Sight of these Objects. Whence it comes to pass, that some through the Stupidity of their Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, endeavouring by Force, and against Reason, to extinguish that Flame, have enjoy'd nothing of true Benefit thereby, but only either disquieted themselves with Smoak and Trouble, or else rushing headlong into obscure and irregular Pleasures, obstinately cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves away. But as many as by sober and modest Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination, have sincerely extinguish'd the raging Heat of the Fire, and only left behind a warm and glowing Heat in the Soul, not being any Agitation of the Soul, moving forward to the Seed, or a slippery Concurrence of Atomes compress'd by smoothness and Titillation; but a wonderful and engendring Diffusion, as in a blossoming and well nourish'd Plant; and opening the Pores of Obedience and Affection; these I say, in a short time, passing through the Bodies of those whom they love, penetrate more inwardly, and fall to admire their Manners and Dispositions, and calling off their Eyes from the Body, converse together, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate one another in their Discourses, and in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, provided there be but the least Scrip or Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Beauty in the Understanding. If not, they let 'em go, and turn their Affections upon others, like Bees that will not fasten upon many Plants and Flowers, because they cannot gather Honey from them. But where they find any Footstep, any Emanation, any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46327:176"/> of a Divinity, ravish'd with delight and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they attract it to themselves, and place their whole content in what is truly amiable, happy and belov'd by all Mankind.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that the Poets according to their sportive humour, seem to write many things in Merriment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Deity, and to make him the Subject of their lascivious Songs, in the height of their Revelling Jollity: making but little serious mention of him; whether out of judgment and reason, or being assur'd of the Truth by divine Inspiration, is the question. Among the rest, there is one thing which they say very odly, concerning the Birth and Generation of this God,
<q>
                        <l>Young <hi>Zephyr</hi> doting on her Golden Hair,</l>
                        <l>At last the Silver-Slipper'd <hi>Iris</hi> won:</l>
                        <l>And thus embrac'd, at length she bore a Son</l>
                        <l>Of all the Gods the shrewdest and most fair.</l>
                     </q> Unless the Grammarians have likewise deluded you, by saying that this Fable was invented, by the variety of the colours in the <hi>Rainbow</hi> to set forth the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd diversity of Passions that attend on Love.</p>
                  <p>To whom <hi>Daphnaeus,</hi> to what other end or purpose could it be? Hear me then, said my Father; for 'tis no more then what the Celestial Meteor constrains us to say. The Reflection of the Colours in the <hi>Rainbow</hi> is an Affection of the Sight, when it lights upon a Cloud somewhat of a dewy substance, but smooth and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately thick withal, and we beholding the repercusion of the Sun-beams upon it, together with the light and splendor about the Sun, it begets an Opinion in us, that the Apparition is in the Cloud. In like manner, this same subtle Invention of Love-Sophistry in generous and noble Souls causes a repercusion of the Memory from beautiful Objects there appearing, and so call'd,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46327:177"/> upon that Beauty really divine, truly amiable and happy, and by all admired. But most People pursuing and taking hold of the fancy'd Image of this Beauty in Boys and Women, reap nothing more assur'd and certain then a little Pleasure mix'd with Pain. But this seems to be more then a Delirium or diziness of the Vulgar sort, beholding their empty and unsatisfy'd desires in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Clouds, as it were in so many Shadows. Like Children, who thinking to catch the <hi>Rainbow</hi> in their hands, snatch at the Apparition that appears before their Eyes. But a generous and modest Lover observes another Method. For his Contemplations reflect only but that Beauty which is divine and preceptible by the Understanding: but lighting upon the Beauty of a visible Body, and making use of it as a kind of Organ of the Memory, he embraces and loves, and by Conversation augmenting his joy and satisfaction, still more and more inflames his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But neither do these Lovers conversing with Bodies, rest satisfy'd in this World with a Desire and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this same Light; neither when they are arriv'd at <hi>Elisyum</hi> after death, do they return hither again as Fugitives, to hover about the Doors and Mansions of new Marry'd People; which are only the Dreams and Visions of Men and Women given to pleasure and corporeal delights, who by no means deserve the Name and Character of true Lovers. Whereas a Lover truly Chaste and Amorous, being got to the true Mansion of Beauty, and there conversing with it, as much as it is lawful for him to do, mounted upon the Wings of chaste desire, becomes pure and hallow'd, and being initiated into sacred Orders, continues dancing and sporting about his Deity, till returning again to the Meadows of the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and there layd asleep, he becomes ready for a new Nativity. But these are Points too high for the Discourse which we have propos'd to our selves.</p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:46327:177"/>
                  <p>To return therefore to our purpose; Love, according to <hi>Euripides,</hi> is of the same Nature with all the rest of the Gods,
<q>
                        <l>That he delights to have his Altars smoak,</l>
                        <l>And mortals hear his honour'd Name invoke.</l>
                     </q> On the otherside he is no less offended, when any Affront or Contempt is put upon him; as he is most kind and benign to those that entertain him with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and respect.

                  <p>Now as for those things which they say are the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that beget Love, they are not peculiar to this or t'other Sex, but common to both. For those Images that enter into Amorous Persons, and whisk above from one Part to another, moving and tickling the Mass of Atoms that slides into the Seed, cannot perform the same in young Boys, and it is as impossible they should do the same in young Women, unless we recal these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and sacred Remembrances with which the Soul is winged to that same Divine, real and Olympic Beauty. What should hinder then but that the same Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances may pass from Boys and Young Men; what should hinder Virgins and Young Women from remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the same things, when we find a Disposition chast good natur'd in the prime of Youth and graceful fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, s eing that, according to what <hi>Aristotle</hi> said, as a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and well made Shoe, shews the Proportion of the Foot, so they that have Judgment in these Matters can discern the splendid upright, and uncorrupted foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of a noble and generous Soul in beautiful Forms and Features, and Bodies undefil'd. For should the Question be be put to a Voluptious Person,
<q>
                        <l>To which are your hot Passions most inclin'd,</l>
                        <l>Or to the Males, or to the Female kind?</l>
                     </q> And he should answer thus,
<q>
                        <l>'Tis the same thing to me,</l>
                        <l>Where ere I Beauty see,</l>
                     </q> There is no reason that he should be thought to have return'd a proper and pertinent Answer to his Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence; and that a noble and generous Lover, should not direct his Amours to loveliness and good Nature, but
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46327:178"/> only to the Parts that distinguish the Sex. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Man that delights in Horses, and is a good Horseman besides, will no less value the Mettle and Swiftness of <hi>Podargus,</hi> then of <hi>Aitha</hi> that was <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> Mare. And he that is a good Hunts-man, does not only delight in Dogs, but mixes with his <hi>Cry</hi> the Bitches of <hi>Candy</hi> and <hi>Laconia:</hi> and shall he that is a Lover as well of civility, carry himself with an inequality more to one than to another, and make a distinction as of Garments between the Love of Men and Women? But some say that Beauty is the Flower of Vertue. Will they then affirm that the Female Sex never blossoms, nor makes any shew of tendency to Vertue: It were absurd to think so. Therefore was <hi>Echylus</hi> in the right, when he said,
<q>
                        <l>The Woman young that once has been a Bride</l>
                        <l>From me her gloating Eye can never hide.</l>
                     </q> Now then are those signs and markes of Lasciviousness, Wantoness and impudence to be discover'd in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of Women, and shall there be no Light shining in their Faces for the discovery of Modesty and Chastity? Nay, shall there be many such signs and those Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and shall they not be able to allure and provoke love? Both are contrary to reason, and dissonant from Truth: but every one of these things is common to both Sexes, as we have shew'd,</p>
                  <p>Now then <hi>Daphnaeus,</hi> let us confute the reason that <hi>Zeuxippus</hi> has but now alledg'd, by making Love to be all one with inordinate desire, that hurrys the Soul to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.

Of which there are some who Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying poor silly Women, for the sake of some petty

And therefore it is an Absurdity to aver, that Women are not capable of other Vertues, as well as Love. For not to speak of so many Signal for their Chastity, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Fidelity; we find others no less Eminent for their Justice, Fortitude, Resolution and Magnanimity; after all which, to tax them of being incapable of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship only, is a hard Case. For they are naturally Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Children, affectionate to their Husbands; and this same Natural Affection of theirs, like a fertile
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46327:181"/> Soyl, as it is capable of Friendship, so it is no less pliable to perswasion nor less accompanied with all the Graces. But as Poetry adapting to Speech the Conditements of Rythm, measure and charming Expression renders the wholsom and instructive Part of it so much the more moving, and the noxious Part so much the more apt to corrupt the Mind, so Nature having adorn'd a Woman with the Charms of Beauty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive Language, a Lascivious Woman makes use of these Perfections to please her self and deceive others, but in a Modest and Sober Woman, they work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders toward the gaining and fixing the good will and favour of her Husband. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> exhorted <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> otherwise generous and brave, but very morose in his humor, to sacrifice to the Graces; but he would have exhorted a Vertuous and Modest Woman to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Love, for his propitious favour to her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in ordering it so, that her behaviour prove may a sufficient Charm, to keep her Husband at Home, or if he will be upon his Rambles after other Women, he may be forc'd to exclaim, as in the Comedy,

The very Mathematical Rudiments do not a little perplex little Children at the first; as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy troubles the Brains of Young beginners, though grown to maturity of Years; so neither does this corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding humour always remain among Lovers, no more then those first unpleasantnesses among Scholars and and Students. In so much that a Man would think that Love at first resembl'd the mixture of two Liquors, which when they once begin to incorporate by their Ebullition discover some little disgusts; for so Love at the beginning bubbles up with a kind of Effervency, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing settl'd and purify'd, it acquires a firm and stable Constitution. For this indeed is properly that kind of mixture, which is call'd the Mixture of the whole through the whole. Whereas the Love of other Friends conversing and living together, is like the touches and interweavings of <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Atoms; subject to raptures and separations, but can never compose such a Union as proceeds from Love, assisting conjugal Society. For neither are the Pleasures receiv'd from any other Love so great, nor the benefits so lasting one from another, nor is the Glory and Beauty of any other Friendship so noble and desirable,

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore in the Country certain Vaults or Cellars under ground, where he had hid his Treasures and Moveables of greatest value, which were only known to two of his freed Bondmen, he dismiss'd all the rest of his Servants, as if he had intended to have poyson'd himself, and taking along with him his two faithful and trusty Servants, he hid himself in one of the Vaults, and sent another of his enfranchiz'd Attendants, whose Name was <hi>Martialus,</hi> to tell his Wife, that her Husband had poyson'd himself, and that the House and his Corps were both burnt together, designing by the Lamentation and unfeigned Greif of his Wife, to make the Report of his Death the more easily believ'd; which fell out according to his Wish. For the Lady, so soon as she heard the News, threw her self upon the Floor, and there continu'd for three days together, without Meat or Drink, making the most bitter out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys, and bewayling her loss with all the marks of a real and unfeigned Anguish. Which <hi>Sabinus</hi> understanding, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46327:185"/> fearing her Sorrow might prevail with her to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands upon her self, he order'd the same <hi>Martinius</hi> to tell her he was yet alive, and lay hid in such a Place; however that she should for a while continue her Mourning and be sure so to counterfeit her Grief, that she should not be discover'd. And indeed in all other things the Lady acted her Part so well, and managed her Passion to that degree, that no Woman could do it better. But having still a longing desire to see her Husband, she went to him in the Night, and return'd again so privately, that no body took any notice of her. And thus she continu'd keeping him Company for seven Months together, that it might be said to differ very little from living in Hell it self. Where after she had so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disguis'd <hi>Sabinus</hi> with a false Head of Hair, and such odd sort of Habit, that it was impossible for him to be known, she carry'd him to <hi>Rome</hi> along with her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discover'd to several that met him. But not being able to obtain his Pardon, she return'd with him back to his Den, and for many Years convers'd with him under Ground; only between whiles she went to the City, and there shew'd her self in Public to several Ladys her Friends and familiar Acquaintance. But that which was the most incredible of all things, she so order'd her business, that none of them perceiv'd her being with Child, though she were very big at the same time. For such is the Nature of that same Oyntment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Women anoynt their Hair to make it of a Colour shining like Gold, that by the Fatness and Oyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it, it plumps and swells up the Flesh of the Body, and brings it up to an <hi>Embonpoint:</hi> So that the Lady no less liberal of her Oyntment, then she was dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to chase and rub her Body limb by limb, by the proportionable rising and swelling of her Flesh in every Part, conceal'd the swelling of her Belly: and when she came to be deliver'd, she endur'd the Pains

Of which there was one who was slain in <hi>Egypt:</hi> the other whose Name was also <hi>Sabiuus,</hi> was but very lately with us at <hi>Delphi.</hi> For this reason <hi>Caesar</hi> put the Lady to death; but dearly paid for the Murder, by the utter extirpation of his whole Posterity, which in a short time after was utterly cut off from the Face of the Earth. For during his whole Reign, there was not a more cruel and savage Act committed; neither was there any other Spectacle, which in all probability the Gods and Daemons more detested, or from which they turn'd away their Eyes in Abomination of the Sight: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that she abated the compassion of the Spectators by the stoutness of her behavior and the Grandeur of her Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance; then which there was nothing more exasperated <hi>Vespasian;</hi> when despairing of her Husbands Pardon, she did as it were challenge the Emperor to exchange her Life for his; telling him with all, that she accounted it a far greater Pleasure to have liv'd in darkness under ground, then to see him Reign in all his Splendor.</p>

But he in the mean time having muster'd together a great Number of his Friends, together with a numerous Troop of his own Servants, whom he secretly dispiers'd and dispos'd up and down in Places proper for his Purpose, watch'd his Opportunity so well, that as the Damsel was going down, according to the Custom of the Country, to the Fountain, call'd <hi>Cissoessa,</hi> there to pay her Offerings to the Nymphs before her Wedding-day, he and his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices rushing out of their <hi>Embuscado,</hi> seiz'd upon the Virgin, whom <hi>Strato</hi> held fast and pull'd to himself.

But the Father and his Friends opposing the Rape, and the Neighbours coming in to the Rescue of the Child, poor <hi>Actaeon,</hi> between the one and the other, was pull'd and hawl'd to Death; and <hi>Archias</hi> with his Company departed.

               <p>A certain poor Man, <hi>Skedasus</hi> by Name, liv'd at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> a small Village in the Territory of the <hi>Thespians,</hi> and had two Daughters, <hi>Hippo</hi> and <hi>Milesia;</hi> or as others say, <hi>Theano</hi> and <hi>Euxippe.</hi> This <hi>Skedasus</hi> was a very good Man, and to the Extent of his Fortune, very Hospitable to Strangers. Which was the reason that most readily and gladly he entertain'd two young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Sparta,</hi> that came to lodge at his House. Who falling in Love with the Virgins, yet were so over-aw'd by the Kindness that <hi>Skedasus</hi> had shew'd them, that they durst not make any rude Attempt for that time. The next Morning therefore they went directly to the City of <hi>Delphos;</hi> where after they had consulted the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, touching such Questions as they had to put, they return'd homeward, and travelling through <hi>Boeotia,</hi> stopp'd again at <hi>Skedasus</hi>'s House, who happen'd at that time, not to be at <hi>Leuctra.</hi> However, his Daughters, according to that Education to which their Father had accustom'd them, gave the same entertainment to the Strangers, as if their Father had been at Home. But such was the perfidious Ingratitude of these Guests, that finding the Virgins alone, they ravish'd, and by force deflowr'd the Damsels; and which was worse, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them lamenting to excess the undeserv'd Injury they had receiv'd, the Ravishers murther'd 'em, and after they had thrown their Bodies into a Well, went their ways: Soon after <hi>Skedasus</hi> returning Home, miss'd both his Daughters, but all things else he found safe and in order as he left them; which put him into such a Quandary, that he knew not what to say or do, till in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by a little Bitch that several times in a Day
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46327:189"/> came whining and fawning upon him, and then return'd to the Well; he began to suspect what he found to be true, and so he drew up the dead Bodies of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Moreover, being then inform'd by his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that they had seen the two <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which he had entertain'd some time before, go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his House, he guess'd them to be the Persons who had committed the Fact, for that they would be always praising the Virgins when they lodg'd there before, and telling their Father what happy Men they would be that should have the good Fortune to marry them. Thereupon away he went to <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> with a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to make his Complaint to the <hi>Ephori;</hi> but being benighted in the Territory of <hi>Argos,</hi> he put into a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick House, where he found another Old Man, of the City of <hi>Oreum,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Hestiaeas;</hi> whom when he heard Sighing and Cursing the <hi>Lacedaemonians, Skedasus</hi> ask'd him what Injury the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> had done him? In answer to which, the Old Man gave him this Account: <hi>I am,</hi> said he, <hi>a Subject to the</hi> Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, <hi>by whom,</hi> Aristodemus <hi>was sent to</hi> Oreum, <hi>to be Governor of that Place, where he committed several Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Savage Enormities. Among the rest, being fallen in Love with my Son, when he could by no fair means procure his Consent, he endeavour'd to carry him away by main Force out of the Wrestling-Place: But the President of the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises opposing him, with the Assistance of several of the Young Men,</hi> Aristodemus <hi>was constrain'd to retire; but the next Day, having provided a Galley to be in a readiness, he ravish'd away my Son, and sailing from</hi> Oreum <hi>to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Continent, endeavour'd, when he had the Boy, there to abuse his Body, and because the Lad refus'd to submit to his Lust, cut the Child's Throat. Ʋpon his Return, he made a great Feast at</hi> Oreum, <hi>to which he invited all his Friends. In the mean while, I being soon inform'd of the sad Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, presently went and interr'd the Body; and having so
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46327:190"/> done, I made haste to</hi> Sparta, <hi>and preferr'd my Complaint to the</hi> Epori, <hi>but they gave me no Answer, nor took any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Skedasus</hi> having heard this Relation, remain'd very much dejected, believing he should have no better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. However, in his Turn, he gave an Account to the Stranger of his own sad Mischance; which when he had done, the Stranger advis'd him not to complain to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> but to return to his own Country, and erect a Monument for his two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But <hi>Skedasus</hi> not liking this Advice, went to <hi>Sparta,</hi> made his Case known to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Justice, who taking no notice of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, away he went to the Kings, but they as little regarding him, he apply'd himself to every particular Citizen, and recommended to them the Sadness of his Condition. At length, when he saw nothing would do he ran through the City, stretching forth his Hands to the Sun, and stamping the Ground with his Feet, call'd upon the Furies to revenge his Cause; and when he had done all he could, in the last place slew himself; but afterwards the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> dearly pay'd for their Injustice. For being at that time Lords of all <hi>Greece,</hi> while all the chiefest Cities of that spacious Region were curb'd by their Garrisons, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> was the first that threw off their Yoak, and cut the Throats of the Garrison that lay in <hi>Thebes.</hi> Upon which, the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> making War upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters, the <hi>Thebans</hi> met them at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> confident of Success from the Name of the Place, for that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had been there deliver'd from Slavery; at what time <hi>Amphyctyon</hi> being driven into Exile by <hi>Sthenelus,</hi> came to the City of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and finding them Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the <hi>Chalcidians,</hi> after he had slain <hi>Chalcodon,</hi> King of the <hi>Eubaeans,</hi> eas'd them altogether of that Burthen. In like manner it happen'd that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46327:190"/> vanquish'd not far from the Monument of <hi>Skedasus</hi>'s Daughters. It is reported also that before the Fight, <hi>Pelopidas</hi> being then one of the <hi>Theban</hi> Generals, and troubled by reason of some certain Signs that seem'd to portend some ill Event of the Battel, <hi>Skedasus</hi> appear'd to him in a Dream, and bid him be of good Courage, for that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were come to <hi>Leuctra</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the just Vengeance which they ow'd to him and his Daughters; only the Ghost advis'd him, the Day before he encounter'd the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> to Sacrifice the Fole of a white Mare, which he should find ready for him close by his Daughters Sepulchre. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> while the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> yet lay encamp'd at <hi>Tegea,</hi> sent certain Persons to examine the Truth of the Matter, and finding by the Inhabitants thereabouts that every thing agreed with his Dream, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd with his Army boldly forward and won the Field.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phocus</hi> was a <hi>Boeotian</hi> by Birth (for he was born in the City of <hi>Cleisas</hi>) the Father of <hi>Challirrhoe,</hi> who was a Virgin of matchless Beauty and Modesty, and courted by thirty young Gentlemen, the Prime of the <hi>Baeotian</hi> Nobility. <hi>Phocus</hi> therefore seeing so many Suitors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, still pretended one Excuse or other to put off her Marriage, afraid least some Force or other should be put upon her. At length, when he could hold out no longer, the Gentlemen being offended at his dilato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Answers, he desir'd them to refer it to the <hi>Pythian</hi> Deity to make the Choice. But this the Gentlemen took so heinously, that they fell upon <hi>Phocus</hi> and slew him. In this Combustion and Tumult, the Virgin making her Escape, fled into the Country, and was as soon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd by the young Sparks; but lighting upon certain Country People that were piling up their Wheat in a Barn, by their Assistance she sav'd her self: for the Country-men hid her in the Corn; so that they who
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46327:191"/> were in chase of her, pass'd her by. The Virgin thus preserv'd, kept her self close till the General Assembly of the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> call'd <hi>Pamboiotia,</hi> and then coming to <hi>Coronea,</hi> she there sate as a Suppliant before the Altar of<note n="*" place="margin">Rather <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conian.</hi>

The <hi>Boeotians</hi> commiserating the Virgin, were no less incens'd against the young Gentlemen; who having notice of what had pass'd, fled to <hi>Orchomenus;</hi> but being shut out by the Citizens, made their Escape to <hi>Hippotae,</hi> a Village near to <hi>Helicon,</hi> seated between <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Coronea,</hi> where they were receiv'd and protected. Thither the <hi>Thebans</hi> sent to have the Murtherers of <hi>Phocus</hi> deliver'd up, which the Inhabitants refusing to do, they march'd against the Town with a good Force of other <hi>Boeotians,</hi> under the Leading of <hi>Phaedus,</hi> then the chief Ruler of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and laying Siege to it, for it was a strong Place, at last they took it for want of Water; and in the first place, having apprehended all the Murtherers, they ston'd them to Death; then they condemn'd the Inhabitants to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Slavery, broke down the Walls, ruin'd the Houses, and divided the Land between the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Coroneans.</hi> The Report goes, that the Night before <hi>Hippotae</hi> was taken, there was a Voice heard from <hi>Helicon,</hi> several times uttering these Words, <hi>I am come;</hi> and that when the thirty Rivals heard it, they knew it to be the Voice of <hi>Phocus;</hi> and it was said moreover, that the very Day the Rivals were ston'd, the Monument of the old Man, which was erected in <hi>Cleisas,</hi> was cover'd with Saffron. And as <hi>Phaedus,</hi> the Governor and General of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> was upon his March homeward from the Siege, News was brought him upon the Way, that his Wife had brought him a Daughter, which for
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46327:191"/> the good Omens Sake, he call'd by the Name of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costrata.</hi>

                     </gap>ppus</hi> being a Person that always advis'd the City for the best, and one that was always ready to serve his Country-men upon all Occasions, was envy'd by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Faction that bandy'd against him, and continually accus'd him to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> as one that endeavour'd to subvert the ancient Laws and Constitutions of the City, and never left till the <hi>Ephori</hi> had banish'd the Husband who being condemn'd, forsook the City; but when <hi>Damocrita</hi> and his Daughters would fain have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him, they would not permit them to stir. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they confiscated his Estate, to deprive his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Portions. Nay, more then this, when there were some that courted the Daughters for the Sake of their Fathers Vertue, his Enemies obtain'd a Decree, whereby it was forbid that any Man should make Love to the young Ladies, cunningly alledging, that the Mother had often pray'd to the Gods to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour her Daughters with speedy Wedlock, to the end they might the sooner bring forth Children to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of the Injury done their Father. <hi>Damocrita</hi> thus beset, and in a Streight on every side, stay'd till the General Festival, when the Women, together with their Daughters, Servants and little Children Feast in publick together; on which day, the Wives of the Magistrates and Persons in Dignity, Feast all Night in a spacious Hall by themselves. But then it was that <hi>Damocrita,</hi> with a Sword girt about her, and taking her Daughters with her, went in the Night-time to the Temple, and watching her Opportunity, when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were all busie in the great Hall, performing the Mysteries of the Solemnity, after all the Ways and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages were stopp'd up, she fetch'd the Wood that was
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46327:192"/> ready prepar'd for the Sacrifices appertaining to the Festival, and pil'd it against the Doors of the Room, and so set Fire to it. All was then in a Hurry, and the Men came crowding in vain to help their Wives; but then it was that <hi>Damocrita</hi> slew her Daughters, and upon their Dead Bodies her self. Thus the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> not knowing upon whom to wreck their Anger, were forc'd to be contented with only throwing the dead Bodies of the Mother and the Daughters without the Confines of their Territories. For which barbarous Act of theirs the Deity being highly offended, plagu'd the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> as their Histories record, with that must dreadful Earthquake, so remarkable to Posterity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>PLato</hi> being desired by the <hi>Cyreneans</hi> to prescribe to them good Laws, and to settle their Government, refused to do it; saying, That it was a hard matter to give them any Law, whilst they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed so much Prosperity; since nothing is so fierce, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and untameable, as a Man that thinks himself to be in a happy Condition: Wherefore it is very difficult to give Counsel to Princes in Matters of Government; for they fear to receive Advice as a thing seeming to command them, least the Force of Reason should seem to lessen their Power, by obliging it to submit to Truth. And they consider not the Saying of <hi>Theopompus,</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who being the first in that Country that joyn'd the<note n="*" place="margin">Certain Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, whose Office it was to inspect the Affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note>
                  <hi>Ephori</hi> with the Kings, was reproached by his Wife, because by this means he would leave the Kingdom to his Children less than he found it, to whom he replied, that he should render it so much the greater, by how much the more firm it was; for by holding the Reins of Government somewhat loose, he avoided all Envy and Danger; nevertheless, since he permitted the Stream of his Power to flow so freely into other Channels, what he gave to them must needs be a Loss to himself. Though Philosophy possessing a Prince as his Assistant and Keeper, by taking away the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46327:193"/> dangerous part of Fulness of Power, leaves the sound. But many Kings and Princes foolishly imitate those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Statuaries, who think to make their Images look Great and Fierce, if they make them much stradling and distended; after the same manner, they, by the grave Tone of their Voice, stern Countenance, and morose Behaviour, would affect a kind of Majestick Grandeur, not unlike those Statues, that without seem to be of an Heroic and Divine Form, but within, are fill'd with nothing but Earth, Stone and Lead, with this only Difference, that the weight of these massie Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies renders them stable and unmoveable, whereas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Princes, by their internal Ignorance, are often sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and overthrown, and in regard they do not build their Power on its true Basis and Foundation, they fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it: For as it is necessary at first that the Rule it self should be right and streight, before those things that are applied to it can be rectified and made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. So a Potentate ought in the first place to learn how to govern his own Passions, and to imbue his Mind with a Tincture of Princely Vertues, and afterwards to make his Subjects conformable to his Example; for it is not the Property of one that is ready to fall himself, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another from Tripping; nor of one that is Rude and Illiterate, to instruct the Ignorant; neither can a Person Govern, that is under no Government. But many being deceived by a false Opinion, esteem it the chiefest Good in Ruling, to be subject to no Authority; and thus the <hi>Persian</hi> King accounted all as his Servants and Slaves except his Wife, whose Master he ought more especially to have been. Who then shall have Power to govern a Prince? The Law, without doubt, which (as <hi>Pindar</hi> saith) is the King of Mortal and Immortal Beings, and is not written without in Books, nor engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on Wood or Stone, but is a clear Reason imprinted in the Heart, always residing and watching therein, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46327:193"/> never suffering the Mind to be without Government. The King of <hi>Persia</hi> indeed, commanded one of his Lords that lay in the same Chamber, to attend him every Morning, and to sound these Words in his Ears: <hi>Arise, O King! and take care of those Affairs and Duties that</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">One of the Gods of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
                  </note> Oromasdes <hi>requires of thee.</hi> But a Wise and Learned Prince hath such a Monitor within his Breast, that always prompts and admonishes him to the same effect. It was a Saying of <hi>Polemon,</hi> that Love was the Minister of the Gods, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to take care of the Education of Youth, but it might be more truly affirmed, that Princes are the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrators of the Divine Power, for the Safety and Protection of Mankind, to distribute part of those Goods that God bestows on Men, and to reserve part for themselves.</p>

It is certain that this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Mind cannot be attained but by the Doctrine of Philosophy; otherwise we shall lye under the same Circumstances as <hi>Alexander,</hi> who seeing <hi>Diogenes</hi> at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> and being astonished at his Ingenuity and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Gravity, let fall this Expression, <hi>If I were not</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, <hi>I would choose to be</hi> Diogenes; for being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most opprest with the Weight of his own Grandeur and Power, which are the Impediments of Vertue and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46327:195"/> he seemed to envy the Happiness of a Thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare Cloak and Pouch, with which the <hi>Cynic</hi> rendred himself as invincible, as he could be with all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, Horses and Spears: However, he had an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to Philosophize, and to become <hi>Diogenes</hi> in his Mind, though he remained <hi>Alexander</hi> in his outward State and Condition; and be might more easily be <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> because he was <hi>Alexander,</hi> forasmuch as to keep the Vessel of his Prosperous Fortune steady, which was tossed with the Winds and Waves, he stood in need of a good quantity of Ballast, and of a skilful Pilot: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the mean and inferior sort of People, Folly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Weakness is destitute of an Ability to do Mischief, and the Mind is vexed and distracted by it at a distempered Brain is with troublesome Dreams, inso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>much that it hath not strength enough to execute what it desires; but Power joyned with a corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Inclination, adds the Fuel of Madness to the Fire of the Passions; so true is that Saying of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who declared that he then chiefly enjoyed his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when he speedily performed what he designed; but herein lyes the greatest Danger, lest he that is able to do all things that he desires, should desire those things that he ought not.</p>

               <p>Vice being furnished with Wheels by Power, sets all the Faculties of the Soul in a violent Fermentation; of Anger it makes Murther, of Love Adultery, and of Covetousness, the Confiscation of other Mens Goods.</p>

               <byline>Translated out of the Original <hi>Greek, by A. G.</hi> Gent.</byline>
               <p>THE Stile, O <hi>Alexander,</hi> of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing simple, free, and easily suiting it self to its Subject, has deceived <hi>many;</hi> but <hi>more</hi> a Perswasion of his Dispositions being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually sincere. For 'tis not only (as <hi>Plato</hi> says) an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Injustice, to make a shew of being Just, when one is not so; but 'tis also the highest Malignity, to pretend to Simplicity and Mildness, and be in the mean time really most Malicious. Now since he principally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orts his Malice against the <hi>Boeotians</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> though without sparing any other, I think my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to defend our Ancestors and the Truth against this part of his Writings, since those, who would detect all his other Lies and Fictions, would have need of many Books. But, as <hi>Sophocles</hi> has it, <hi>the Face of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion is prevalent,</hi> especially when deliver'd in good Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and such as has Power to conceal both the other Absurdities, and the ill Nature of the Writer. King <hi>Philip</hi> told the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who revolted from him to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46327:197"/>
                  <hi>Titus Quinctius,</hi> that they had got a more polisht, but a longer-lasting Yoke: So the Malice of <hi>Herodotus</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more polite and delicate than that of <hi>Theopompus,</hi> yet it pinches closer, and makes a more severe Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not unlike to those Winds, which blowing secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through narrow Chinks, are sharper than those that are more diffus'd. Now it seems to me very convenient to delineate, as it were in a rough Draught, those Signs and Marks that distinguish a malicious Narration From a candid and unbiass'd one, applying afterwards every Point we shall examine, to such as appertain to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> then, Whoever in relating a Story shall use o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Terms, when gentler Expressions might do as well, he is not to be esteemed impartial, but an Enjoyer of his own Fancy in putting the worst Construction on Things; as if any one, instead of saying <hi>Nicias</hi> is too precise, should call him Phanatick, or should accuse <hi>Cleon</hi> of Presumption and Madness, rather than of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerateness in Speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When a Writer, catching hold of a Fault which has no reference to his Story, shall draw it into the Relation of such Affairs, as need it not, extending his Narrative with Circumlocutions, only that he may insert a Mans Misfortune, Offence, or discommendable Action, 'tis manifest that he delights in speaking Evil. Therefore <hi>Thucydides</hi> would not clearly relate the Faults of <hi>Cleon,</hi> which were very numerous; and as for <hi>Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the Orator, having toucht at him in a Word, and call'd him an ill Man, he let him go. <hi>Philistus</hi> also pass'd over all those Outrages committed by <hi>Dionysius</hi> on the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which had no Connexion with the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Affairs. For the Excursions and Digressions of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story are principally allow'd for Fables and Antiquities, and sometimes also for Encomiums. But he, who makes Reproaches and Detractions an Addition to his Discourse,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46327:198"/> seems to incur the <hi>Tragedians</hi> Curse on <hi>the Collector of Mens Calamities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Opposite to this is known to every one, as the omitting to relate some good and laudable Action, which, though it may seem not to be reprehensible, yet is then done maliciously, when the Omission happens in a Place, that is pertinent to the History. For to praise unwillingly, is so far from being more Civil than to dispraise willingly, that 'tis perhaps rather more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Sign of a partial Disposition in writing of History, I take to be this, when, a Matter being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in two or more several manners, the Historian shall embrace the worst. Sophisters indeed are permitted for the obtaining either of Profit or Reputation, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Defence of the worse Cause; for they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther create any firm Belief of the Matter, nor yet do they deny, that they are often pleased in maintaining Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes, and making incredible things appear probable. But an Historian is then just, when he asserts such things, as he knows to be true, and of those, that are uncertain, reports rather the better, than the worse. Nay there are many Writers, who wholly omit the Worse. Thus <hi>Ephorus</hi> writes of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> that he was acquainted with the Treason of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> and his Negotiations with the Kings Lieutenants; but that he neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to it, nor hearkned to <hi>Pausanias</hi>'s Proffers of making him partaker of his Hopes. And <hi>Thucydides</hi> left the whole Matter out of his Story, as judging it to be false. Moreover in things, confess'd to have been done, but of doing which the Cause and Intention is unknown, he, who casts his Conjectures on the worse side, is partial and malicious. Thus do the <hi>Comedians,</hi> who affirm the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War to have been kindled by <hi>Pericles</hi> for the Love of <hi>Aspasia,</hi> or the Sake of <hi>Phidias,</hi> and not through any Desire of Honour or Ambition of pulling
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46327:198"/> down the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> Pride, and giving place in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> For those who suppose a bad Cause for laudable Works and commendable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, endeavouring by Calumnies to insinuate sinister Suspicions of the Actor, when they cannot openly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Act; as they, that impute the Killing of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Tyrant by <hi>Theba</hi> not to any Magnanimity, or Hatred of Vice, but to a certain feminine Jealousie and Passion; and those, that say, <hi>Cato</hi> slew himself for fear, <hi>Caesar</hi> should put him to a more shameful Death: such as these are manifestly in the highest degree envious and malicious.</p>
               <p>An Historical Narration is also more or less guilty of Malice, according as it relates the manner of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as if one should be said to have perform'd an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit rather by Money, than Vertue, as some affirm of <hi>Philip;</hi> or else easily, and without any Labour, as 'tis said of <hi>Alexander;</hi> or else not by Prudence, but Fortune, as the Enemies of <hi>Timotheus</hi> painted Cities falling into his Nets, as he lay sleeping; for they undoubtedly diminish the Greatness and Beauty of the Actions, who deny the Performers of them to have done them generously, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously, vertuously, and by themselves.</p>
               <p>Moreover, those who will directly speak ill of any one, incur the Reproach of Moroseness, Rashness, Madness, unless they keep within Measure. But they who send forth Calumnies obliquely, as if they were shooting Arrows out of Corners, and then stepping back, think to conceal themselves by saying, they do not believe, what they most earnestly desire to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, whilst they disclaim all Malice, condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also farther of Disingenuity. Next to these are they, who with their Reproaches intermix some Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; as did <hi>Aristoxenus,</hi> who, having term'd <hi>Socrates</hi> Unlearned, Ignorant and Libidinous, added, <hi>Yet was he free from Injustice.</hi> For, as they who flatter artificially,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46327:199"/> and craftily, sometimes mingle light Reprehensions with their many and great Praises, joyning this Liberty of Speech, as a Sauce to their Flattery: so Malice, that it may gain Belief to its Accusations, adds also Praise. We might here also reckon up more Notes, but these are sufficient to let us understand the Nature and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Herodotus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> therefore, beginning, as the Proverb is, with <hi>Vesta,</hi> whereas all the <hi>Grecians</hi> affirm <hi>Io,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Inachus,</hi> to have been worshipt with Divine Honour by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> for her Glory, to have left her Name to many Seas and principal Ports, and to have given a Source and Original to most Noble and Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; this famous Author says of her, that she gave her self to certain <hi>Phaenician</hi> Merchants, having been not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly destowr'd by a Mariner, and fearing, left she should be found by her Friends to be with Child. And he belyes the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> as having deliver'd these things of her, and says, that the <hi>Persian</hi> Stories testifie her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carry'd away by the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> with other Women. Presently after he gives Sentence on the bravest and greatest Exploits of <hi>Greece,</hi> saying, that the <hi>Trojan</hi> War was foolishly undertaken for an ill Woman. <hi>For 'tis manifest,</hi> says he, <hi>that had they not been willing, they had never been ravisht.</hi> Let us then say, that the Gods also acted foolishly, in inflicting their Indignation on the <hi>Spartans,</hi> for abusing the Daughters of <hi>Skedasus</hi> the <hi>Leuctrian,</hi> and in punishing <hi>Ajax</hi> for the Violation of <hi>Cassandra.</hi> For 'tis manifest, if we believe <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that, if they had not been willing, they had never been defil'd. And yet he himself said, that <hi>Aristomenes</hi> was taken alive by the <hi>Spartans;</hi> and the same afterwards hapned to <hi>Philopaemen,</hi> Praetor of the <hi>Achaians;</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> took <hi>Regulus,</hi> the Consul of the <hi>Romans;</hi> than whom there are not easily to be found more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and warlike Men. Nor is it to be wondred, since
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46327:199"/> the very Leopards and Tigers are taken alive by Men. But <hi>Herodotus</hi> blames the poor Women that have been abus'd by Violence, and Patronizes their Ravishers. Nay, he is so favorable to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that acquitting <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siris</hi> of those Human Sacrifices, and that Slaughter of his Guests, for which he is accus'd, and attributing by his Testimony to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> much Religion and Justice, he endeavours to cast that abominable Wickedness, and those impious Murthers on the <hi>Grecians.</hi> For in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book, he says, that <hi>Menelaus</hi> having received <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena</hi> from <hi>Proteus,</hi> and been honour'd by him with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Presents, shew'd himself a most unjust and wicked Man. For wanting a sit Wind to set Sail, he found out an impious Device, and having taken two of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants Boys, consulted their Entrals; for which Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany being hated and persecuted, he fled with his Ships directly into <hi>Africa.</hi> From what <hi>Aegyptian</hi> this Story proceeds, I know not. For on the contrary many Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are even at this day given by the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> both to <hi>Helena</hi> and <hi>Menelaus.</hi> The same <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that he may still be like himself, says, that the <hi>Persians</hi> learnt the Defiling of the Male Sex from the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And yet how could the <hi>Greeks</hi> have taught this Impurity to the <hi>Persians,</hi> amongst whom, 'tis confess'd by all, that Boys were castrated, before ever they arriv'd in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Seas? He writes also, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were instructed by the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in their Pomps, Solemn Festivals, and Worship of the twelve Gods: that <hi>Melampus</hi> also learnt of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> the Name of <hi>Dionysius</hi> [or <hi>Bacchus</hi>] and taught it the other <hi>Greeks;</hi> that the Mysteries likewise and Rites of <hi>Ceres</hi> were brought out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by the Daughters of <hi>Danaus;</hi> and that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were wont to beat themselves and make great Lamentation, but yet would not tell the Names of their Deities, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd them in Silence. As to <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whom the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> nam'd Gods, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> very aged
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46327:200"/> Men, he no where makes use of this Distinction, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he places also the <hi>Aegyptian-Hercules</hi> amongst the Gods of the second Rank, and <hi>Bacchus</hi> amongst those of the third, as who had some Beginning of their Being, and were not Eternal, and yet he pronounces those to be Gods, but to these as having been Mortal, and being now Demi-Gods, he thinks we ought to perform Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary Solemnities, but not to Sacrifice to them as to Gods. The same also he said of <hi>Pan,</hi> overthrowing the most venerable and purest Sacrifices of the <hi>Greeks</hi> by the proud Vanities and Mythologies of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> Nor is this impious enough. But moreover, deriving the Pedigree of <hi>Hercules</hi> from <hi>Perseus,</hi> he says, that <hi>Perseus</hi> was an <hi>Assyrian,</hi> as the <hi>Persians</hi> affirm. <hi>But the Leaders,</hi> says he, <hi>of the</hi> Dorians <hi>may appear to be descended in a right Line from the</hi> Aegyptians, <hi>reckoning their Ancestors from before</hi> Danae <hi>and</hi> Acrisius. For he has wholly pass'd by <hi>Epaphus, Io, Jasus,</hi> and <hi>Argus,</hi> being not only ambitious to make the other <hi>Herculeses Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> but to carry this also, whom himself says to have been the third, out of <hi>Greece</hi> to the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But of the ancient learned Writers, neither <hi>Homer,</hi> nor <hi>Hesiod,</hi> nor <hi>Archilochus,</hi> nor <hi>Pisander,</hi> nor <hi>Stesichorus,</hi> nor <hi>Alcman,</hi> nor <hi>Pindar,</hi> make any mention of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> or <hi>Phenician Hercules,</hi> but do all acknowledge this our one <hi>Baeotian</hi> and <hi>Argive Hercules.</hi> Now of the seven Sages, whom he calls Sophisters, he affirms <hi>Thales</hi> to have been a <hi>Babarian,</hi> descended of the <hi>Phaenicians.</hi> Speaking ill also of the Gods under the Person of <hi>Solon,</hi> he has these Words: <hi>Thou, O</hi> Craesus, <hi>askst me concerning Human Affairs, who know, that every one of the Deities is envious and tumultuous.</hi> Thus attributing to <hi>Solon,</hi> what himself thinks of the Gods, he joyns Malice to Blasphemy. Having made use also of <hi>Pittacus</hi> in some trivial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not worth the mentioning, he has pass'd over the greatest and gallantest Action that was ever done by
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46327:200"/> him. For when the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Mitylenians</hi> were at War about the <hi>Sigaeum, Phegnon,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> General, challenging, whoever would come forth, to a single Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, <hi>Pittacus</hi> advanc'd to meet him, and catching him in a Net, slew that stout and giant-like Man, For which, when the <hi>Mitylenians</hi> offer'd him great Presents, darting his Javelin, as far as he could, out of his Hand, he desir'd only so much Ground, as he should reach with that Throw, the Place being to this Day called <hi>Pittacium.</hi> Now what does <hi>Herodotus,</hi> when he comes to this? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Pittacus</hi>'s valiant Act, he tells us the Flight of <hi>Alcaeus</hi> the Poet, who, throwing away his Arms, ran out of the Battle; by this his not writing of honorable Deeds, and not passing over such, as are dishonorable, giving his Testimony to those, who say, that from one and the same Malice proceed both Envy, and a Rejoycing at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Harms.</p>
               <p>After this, he accuses of Treason the <hi>Alcmaeonidae,</hi> who shew'd themselves generous Men, and deliver'd their Country from Tyranny. He says, that they receiv'd <hi>Pisistratus</hi> after his Banishment, and got him call'd Home, on condition he should marry the Daughter of <hi>Migacles;</hi> but that the Damsel saying to her Mother, <hi>Do you see, Mother, how I am, contrary to Nature, known by</hi> Pisistratus? The <hi>Alcmaeonidae</hi> were so offended at this Villany, that they expell'd the Tyrant. Now that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> might have no less Share of his Malice than the <hi>Athenians,</hi> behold how he bespatters <hi>Othryades,</hi> the Man, most admir'd and honour'd by them. <hi>He only,</hi> says <hi>Herodotus, remaining alive of the three hundred, and asham'd to return to</hi> Sparta, <hi>his Companions being lost, slew himself in the Place.</hi> For having before said, the Victory was doubtful on both sides, he here, by making <hi>Othryaders</hi> asham'd, witnesses, that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were vanquisht. For 'twas shameful for him to survive, if conquer'd; but glorious if Conqueror. I pass by now, that having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46327:201"/>
                  <hi>Craesus,</hi> as foolish, vainglorious, and ridiculous in all things, he makes him, when a Prisoner, to have taught and instructed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who seems to have excell'd all other Kings in Prudence, Vertue and Magnanimity. Having testify'd of the same <hi>Craesus</hi> nothing else that was commendable, but his honouring the Gods with many and great Oblations, he shews that very Act of his to have been the most impious of all. For he says, that he and his Brother <hi>Pantaleon</hi> contended for the Kingdom, while their Father was yet, alive; and that <hi>Craesus</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtain'd the Crown, caus'd a Companion and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friend of <hi>Pantaleons</hi> to be torn in pieces in a Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Mill, and sent Presents, made of his Money, to the Gods. Of <hi>Deioces</hi> also, the <hi>Median,</hi> who by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Justice obtain'd the Government, he says, that he got it not by real, but pretended Justice. But I let pass the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Examples, since he has offer'd us Plenty enough in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Affairs. He says, that the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and many other <hi>Ionians</hi> were so asham'd of that Name, that they wholly refus'd to be call'd <hi>Ionians;</hi> and that those, who esteem'd themselves the noblest amongst them, and descended from the very <hi>Prytaneum</hi> [or <hi>Senate</hi>] of <hi>Athens,</hi> begat Children on <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian</hi> Wives, whose Parents and former Children they had slain; that the Women had therefore made a Law among themselves, confirm'd it by Oath, and deliver'd it to be kept by their Daughters, never to eat with their Husbands, nor to call any of them by his Name, and that the present <hi>Milesians</hi> are descended from these Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Having afterwards added, that those are true <hi>Ionians,</hi> who celebrate the Feast call'd <hi>Apaturia: They all,</hi> says he, <hi>keep it, except the</hi> Ephesians <hi>and</hi> Colophonians: In this manner does he deprive these two States of their Nobility. He says moreover, that the <hi>Cumaeans</hi> and <hi>Mitylenians</hi> agreed with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to deliver up to him for a Price <hi>Pactyas,</hi> who had revolted from him: <hi>I know
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46327:201"/> not indeed,</hi> says he, <hi>for how much, since 'tis not certain what it was.</hi> But he ought not to have cast such an Infamy on a <hi>Grecian</hi> City, without a more assured Knowledge. He says farther, that the <hi>Chians</hi> drew <hi>Pactyas,</hi> who was brought to them out of the Temple of <hi>Minerva Poliuchus</hi> [or Guardianess of the City] and deliver'd him up, having receiv'd the Field <hi>Atarnes</hi> for their Recompence; and yet <hi>Charon</hi> the <hi>Lampsacenian,</hi> a more ancient Writer, relating this Matter concerning <hi>Pactyas,</hi> charges neither the <hi>Mitylenians</hi> nor the <hi>Chians</hi> with any such Action. These are his very Words. Pactyas, <hi>hearing, that the</hi> Persian <hi>Army drew near, fled first to</hi> Mitylene, <hi>then to</hi> Chios, <hi>and fell into the Hands of</hi> Cyrus.</p>
               <p>Our Author in his third Book, relating the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> against the Tyrant <hi>Polycrates,</hi> affirms, that the <hi>Samians</hi> think and say, that the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> to recompence them for their former Assistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Messenians,</hi> both brought back the <hi>Samians,</hi> that were banisht, and made War on the Tyrant. But that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> deny this, and say, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took not this Design to help or deliver the <hi>Samians,</hi> but to punish them for having taken away a Cup sent by them to <hi>Craesus;</hi> and besides, a Breast-plate sent them by <hi>Amasis.</hi> And yet we know, that there was not at that time any City, so desirous of Honour, or such an Enemy to Tyrants, as <hi>Sparta.</hi> For what Breast-plate or Cup was the Cause of their driving the <hi>Clypselioae</hi> out of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> and <hi>Ambracia, Lygdamis</hi> out of <hi>Naxos,</hi> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Pisistratus</hi> out of <hi>Athens, Aeschines</hi> out of <hi>Sicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Symmachus</hi> out of <hi>Thasus, Aulis</hi> out of <hi>Phoceae,</hi> and <hi>Aristogenes</hi> out of <hi>Miletus?</hi> and of their overturning the domineering Powers of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> pulling down <hi>Aristode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Angelus</hi> by the help of King <hi>Leotichides?</hi> which Facts are elsewhere more largely describ'd. Now if <hi>Herodotus</hi> says true, they were in the highest degree
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46327:202"/> guilty both of Malice and Folly, when denying a most honorable and most just Cause of their Expedition, they confess'd, that in remembrance of a former Injury, and through highly valuing an inconsiderable Matter, they invaded a miserable and afflicted People. Now perhaps he gave the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> this Stroke, as directly fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his Pen; but the City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which was wholly out of the Course of his Story, he has in his passing by it, as they say, bespatter'd with a most filthy Crime, and most shameful Calumny. <hi>The</hi> Corinthians, says he, <hi>studiously forwarded this Journey of the</hi> Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <hi>as having themselves also been formerly affronted by the</hi> Samians. <hi>The Matter was this;</hi> Periander, <hi>Tyrant of</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, <hi>sent three hundred Boys, Sons to the principal Men of</hi> Corfu, <hi>to King</hi> Alyattes, <hi>to be gelt. These, going ashore in the Island of</hi> Samos, <hi>were by the</hi> Samians <hi>taught to sit, as Suppliants, in the Temple of</hi> Diana, <hi>where they preserv'd them, setting before them for their Food Cakes made of Sesam-Seed and Honey.</hi> This our Author calls an Affront, put by the <hi>Samians</hi> on the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who therefore instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> against them; to wit, because the <hi>Samians</hi> had sav'd the Children of the <hi>Greeks</hi> from being unmann'd. By attributing this Villany to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he makes the City more wicked than the Tyrant. He indeed reveng'd himself on those of <hi>Corfu,</hi> who had slain his Son. But what had the <hi>Corinthians</hi> suffer'd, that they should punish the <hi>Samians</hi> for putting an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle to so great a Cruelty and Wickedness? And this, after three Generations, reviving the Memory of an old Quarrel for the Sake of that Tyranny, which they found so grievous and intollerable, that they are still endlesly abolishing all the Monuments and Marks of it, though long since extinct. Such then was the Injury done by the <hi>Samians</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Now what a kind of Punishment was it, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> would have inflicted on them? Had they been indeed angry with
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46327:202"/> the <hi>Samians,</hi> they should not have incited, but rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> from their War against <hi>Polycra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that the <hi>Samians</hi> might not by the Tyrants Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, recover Liberty, and be freed from their Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But what is most to be observ'd, why were the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> so offended with the <hi>Samians,</hi> that desir'd indeed, but were not able to save the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> Children, and yet were not displeas'd with the <hi>Cnidians,</hi> who both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd them, and restor'd them to their Friends? Nor indeed have the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> any great Esteem for the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> on this Account; but of the <hi>Cnidians</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Memorial, having granted them several Honors and Priviledges, and made Decrees in their Favour. For these, sailing to <hi>Samos,</hi> drave away <hi>Perianders</hi> Guards from the Temple, and taking the Children aboard their Ships, carry'd them safe to <hi>Corfu,</hi> as 'tis recorded by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor</hi> the <hi>Cretan,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Chalcidian</hi> in his <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Now that the <hi>Spartans</hi> undertook not this War on any design of punishing the <hi>Samians,</hi> but to save them by delivering them from the Tyrant, we have the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the <hi>Samians</hi> themselves. For they affirm, that there is in <hi>Samos</hi> a Monument, erected at the publick Charge, and Honours there done to <hi>Archias</hi> a <hi>Spartan,</hi> who, fighting valiantly, fell in that Quarrel; for which Cause also his Posterity still keep a familiar and friendly Correspondence with the <hi>Samians,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> himself witnesses.</p>
               <p>In his Fifth Book he says, that <hi>Clisthenes,</hi> one of the best and noblest Men in <hi>Athens,</hi> perswaded the Priestess <hi>Pythia</hi> to be a false Prophetess, always exhorting the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to free <hi>Athens</hi> from the Tyrants; calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating this most excellent and just Action by the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so great a Wickedness and Imposture, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the God the Credit of that true and good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, beseeming even <hi>Themis</hi> her self, who is also said to have joyn'd with him. He says farther, that <hi>Isagoras</hi>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:46327:203"/> prostituted his Wife to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> who came to her. Then, as his manner is, to gain Credit, mixing some Praises with his Reproaches, he says: Isagoras, <hi>The Son of</hi> Tisander, <hi>was of a Noble Family, but I cannot tell the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of it. His Kinsmen indeed Sacrifice to</hi> Jupiter Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. O this pleasant and cunning Scoffer of a Writer, who thus disgracefully sends <hi>Isagoras</hi> to the <hi>Carians,</hi> as it were to the Ravens. As for <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> he puts him not forth at the Back-door, but thrusts him directly out of the Gate into <hi>Phaenicia;</hi> saying, that he had his Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the <hi>Gephyraeans,</hi> and that the <hi>Gephyraeans</hi> were not, as some think, <hi>Eubaeans</hi> or <hi>Eretrians,</hi> but <hi>Phaenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as himself is fully perswaded. And since he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not altogether take from the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> the Glory of having deliver'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> from the Tyrants, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to cloud and disgrace that most honorable Act by as foul a Passion. For he says, they presently repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, as not having done well, in that they had, by the Inducement of spurious and deceitful Oracles, driven the Tyrants, who were their Allies, and had promis'd to put <hi>Athens</hi> into their Hands, out of their Conntry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd the City to an ungrateful People. He adds, that they were about to send for <hi>Hippias</hi> from <hi>Sigaeum,</hi> and bring him back to <hi>Athens;</hi> but that they were oppos'd by the <hi>Corinthians, Sosicles</hi> telling them how much the City of <hi>Corinth</hi> had suffer'd under the Tyranny of <hi>Cypselus</hi> and <hi>Periander;</hi> and yet there was no Outrage of <hi>Perianders</hi> more abominable and cruel, than his sending the three hundred Children to be emasculated, for the delivering and saving of whom from that contumely, the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he says, were angry, and bore a Grudge against the <hi>Samians,</hi> as having put an Affront upon them.

For when all <hi>Ionia</hi> was in a Confusion [and Uproar] and the Kings Fleet drew nigh, they, going forth to meet him, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in a Sea Fight the <hi>Cyprians</hi> in the <hi>Pamphilian</hi> Sea. Then turning back, and leaving their Ships at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> they invaded <hi>Sardis,</hi> and besieg'd <hi>Artaphernes,</hi> who was fled into the Castle, that so they might raise the Siege of <hi>Miletus.</hi> And this indeed they affected, caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemies [to break up their Camp, and] re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thence in a wonderful Fright, and then seeing themselves in danger to be oppress'd by a Multitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.

                  <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> gave the <hi>Plataeans</hi> this Advice, not so much for any good Will, as through a Desire to find Work for the <hi>Athenians,</hi> by engaging them with the <hi>Boeotians.</hi> If then <hi>Herodotus</hi> is not Malicious, the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians</hi> must have been both fraudulent and spightful, the <hi>Athenians</hi> Fools, in suffering themselves to be thus impos'd on, and the <hi>Plataeans</hi> were brought into play, not for any good Will or Respect, but as an Occasion of War. He is farther manifestly convinc'd of belying the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> when he says, that, whilst they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Full Moon, they fail'd of giving their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to the <hi>Athenians</hi> at <hi>Marathon.</hi> For they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a thousand other Excursions and Fights at the beginning of the Month, without staying for the Full Moon; but wanted so little of being present at this very Battle, which was fought the sixth Day of the Montn <hi>Boedromion,</hi> that at their coming they found the Dead still lying in the Field.

And professing to write of the <hi>Greek</hi> Affairs, but more particularly and carefully those of <hi>Athens,</hi> thou dost not so much as say a Word of that solemn Pomp, which the <hi>Athenians,</hi> even at this Day, send to <hi>Agra,</hi> celebrating a Feast of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to <hi>Hecate</hi> for their Victory. But this helps <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> to refel the Crime, with which he is charg'd, of having flatter'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> for a great Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he receiv'd of them. For if he had rehears'd these things to them, they would not have omitted or
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:46327:204"/> neglected that wicked <hi>Philippides,</hi> who, going from the Fight, call'd the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to it, especially since he went, as himself says, in two Days from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> unless the <hi>Athenians</hi> sent for their Allies to the Fight, after their Enemies were overcome. Indeed <hi>Diyllus</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> none of the most contemptible Historians, says, that he received from <hi>Athens</hi> a Present of ten Talents, <hi>Anytus</hi> proposing the Decree. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Herodotus,</hi> as many say, has in relating the Fight at <hi>Marathon,</hi> derogated from the Credit of it, by the Number he sets down of the Slain. For he writes, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> made a Vow to Sacrifice so many Kids to <hi>Diana Agrotera,</hi> as they should kill <hi>Barbarians;</hi> but that after the Fight, the Number of the Dead ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing infinite, they appeas'd the Goddess by making a Decree, to immolate five hundred to her every year. But letting this pass, let us see, what was done after the Fight. <hi>The</hi> Barbarians, says he, <hi>retiring back with the rest of their Ships, and taking the</hi> Eretrian <hi>Slaves out of the Island, where they had left them, doubled the Point of</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, <hi>desiring to prevent the</hi> Athenians, <hi>before they could gain the City. The</hi> Athenians <hi>suspected this to have been done by a Plot of the</hi> Alcmaeonidae, <hi>who by Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shew'd a Shield to the</hi> Persians <hi>when they were got into their Ships. They therefore doubled the Cape of</hi> Suni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Let us in this place take no notice of his calling the <hi>Eretrians</hi> Slaves, who shew'd as much Courage and Gallantry in this War, as any other of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and suffer'd things, unworthy their Vertue. Nor let us insist much on the Calumny, with which he defames the <hi>Alcmaeonidae,</hi> of whom, were both the greatest Families, and noblest Men of the City. The Greatness of the Victory it self is overthrown, and the End of that so celebrated Action comes to nothing; nor does it seem to have been a Fight, or any great Exploit; but only a light Skirmish with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as the Envious and
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46327:205"/> Ill-willers affirm, if they did not after the Battle fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, cutting their Cables, and giving themselves to the Wind, for to carry them as far as might be from the <hi>Attick</hi> Coast; but having a Shield lifted up to them as a Signal of Treason, made straight with their Fleet for <hi>Athens,</hi> in hope to surprise it, and having at leisure doubled the Point of <hi>Sunium,</hi> were discovered above the Port <hi>Phalerus,</hi> so that the Chief and most Illustrious Men, despairing to save the City, would have betray'd it: for a little after, acquitting the <hi>Alcmaeonidae,</hi> he charges others with the Treason. <hi>For the Shield indeed was shewn, nor can it be deny'd,</hi> says he, as if he had seen it himself. But this could no way be, since the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> obtain'd a solid Victory; and if it had been done, it could not have been seen by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> flying in an Hurry amidst Wounds and Arrows into their Ships, and leaving every one the Place with all possible speed. But when he again pretends to excuse the <hi>Alcmaeoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae</hi> of those Crimes, which he, first of all Men, objected against them, he speaks thus. <hi>I cannot bear this Discourse, that the</hi> Alcmeonidae <hi>by agreement, lifted up a Shield to the</hi> Persians, <hi>and would have brought the</hi> Athenians <hi>under the Power of the</hi> Barbarians <hi>and</hi> Hippias. I remember a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clause, [the Tenor of which, is this:] <hi>You will take me, and having taken me, let me go.</hi> Thus you first Accuse, then Apologize, and write Calumnies against Illustrious Men, which again you refute; to wit, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crediting your self. For you heard your self say, that the <hi>Alcmaeonidae</hi> lifted up a Shield to the vanquisht and flying <hi>Barbarians.</hi> And in those very things, which you alledge for the <hi>Alcmaeonidae,</hi> you shew your self a Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. For if, as here you write, the <hi>Alcmaeonidae</hi> were more, or no less Enemies to Tyrants, than <hi>Callias</hi> the Son of <hi>Phoenippus,</hi> and Father of <hi>Hipponicus,</hi> where will you place their Conspiracy, of which you write in your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Books, that assisting <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> they brought him
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:46327:205"/> back from Exile to the Tyranny, and did not drive him away, till he was accus'd of unnaturally abusing his Wife? Such then are the Repugnancies of these things, and by his intermixing the Praises of <hi>Callias,</hi> the Son of <hi>Phoenippus,</hi> amidst the Crimes and Suspicions of the <hi>Alc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeonidae,</hi> and joyning to him his Son <hi>Hipponicus,</hi> who was, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> himself says, one of the richest Men in <hi>Athens,</hi> he confesses, that he brought in <hi>Callias,</hi> not for any necessity of the Story, but to ingratiate himself, and gain Favour with <hi>Hipponicus.</hi> Now, whereas all know, that the <hi>Argives</hi> deny not to enter into the common League of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> though they thought not sit to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and be under the Command of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who were their mortal Enemies, and that this was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, [our Author] subjoyns a most malicious Cause for it, writing thus, <hi>When [they saw] they were comprised by the</hi> Greeks, <hi>knowing that the</hi> Lacedaemonians <hi>would not admit them into a share of the Command, they requested it, that they might have a Pretence to lye still.</hi> And of this, he says, the <hi>Argive</hi> Embassadors afterwards put <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in mind, when they attended him at <hi>Susa,</hi> and that he said, He esteem'd no City more his Friend than <hi>Argos.</hi> Then adding, as his Manner is, to cover the Matter, he says. <hi>Of these things I know nothing certainly; but this I know, that all Men have Faults, and that the worst things were not done by the</hi> Argives. <hi>But I must tell such things a are reported, though I am not bound to believe them all; and let this be understood of all my Narrations. For 'tis farther said, that the</hi> Argives, <hi>when they were not able to sustain the War against the</hi> Lacedaemonians, <hi>call'd the</hi> Persian <hi>into</hi> Greece, <hi>willing rather to suffer any thing than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Trouble.</hi> Therefore, what himself reports she <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi> to have said of the Ointment and Purple, <hi>Deceitful are the Beauties, deceitful the Garments of the</hi> Persians; may not any one say the same of him; <hi>Deceitful are the Phrases, deceitful the Figures of</hi> Herodotus<hi>'s Speeches, as

If the <hi>Argives</hi> joyn'd not with the other <hi>Greeks,</hi> but stood out through an Emulation of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Valor, it cannot be deny'd, but that they acted in a manner, not beseeming their Nobility and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent from <hi>Hercules.</hi> For it had been more honorable for the <hi>Siphnians</hi> and <hi>Cythnians</hi> to have defended the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Liberty, than contending with the <hi>Spartans</hi> for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, to have avoided so many, and such signal Combats.

But now, when he says, that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were betray'd by the other <hi>Greeks;</hi> and that being left alone, and having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken great Exploits, they dy'd generously, having before seen that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> favouring the <hi>Medes,</hi> held In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with <hi>Xerxes,</hi> 'tis manifest, he speaks not these things so much to the Commendation of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as that, praising the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he may speak ill of all the rest. For how can any one now be angry with him for so bittery and outragiously, at every turn, upbraiding
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46327:206"/> the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Phocaeans,</hi> when he charges even those, who expos'd themselves to all Perils for <hi>Greece,</hi> with a Treason, which, as himself says, was never acted? Nay, of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> themselves, he makes it doubtful, whether they fell in the Battle, or yielded to the Enemy, distinguishing them by very slight Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures from those that were slain at <hi>Thermopylae.</hi>

Now, whereas <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristophanes</hi> the <hi>Boeotian</hi> wrote, that having demanded Money of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> he receiv'd none, and that going about to discourse and reason with the young Men, he was prohibited by the Magistrates through their Clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishness and Hatred of Learning; of which there is no other Argument. But <hi>Herodotus</hi> bears Witness to <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> whilst he charges the <hi>Thebans</hi> with some things falsly, with others ignorantly, and with others, as hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and having a Quarrel with them. For he affirms, that the <hi>Thessalians</hi> at first, upon necessity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to the <hi>Medes,</hi> in which he says the Truth; and prophesying of the other <hi>Grecians,</hi> that they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the <hi>Lacedaemonians;</hi> he added, that they would not do it willingly, but upon Necessity, one City being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after another.

                  </gap>pt Conditions of Peace, to which they were compell'd by great Necessity. For they had neither the Sea and Ships at hand, as had the <hi>Athenians,</hi> nor did they dwell far off, as the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who inhabited the most remote parts of <hi>Greece;</hi> but were not above a Day and an halfs Journey from the <hi>Medians</hi> Army, whom they had already with the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> and <hi>Thespians</hi> alone resisted at the Entrance of the Streights, and were defeated. But this Writer is so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable, that having said the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> being alone, and deserted by their Allies, would perhaps make a Composition with the Enemy, when he could not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliterate this most great and glorious Act of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> yet went about to deface it with a most vile Imputation and Suspicion, writing thus: <hi>The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, who had been sent, return'd back, obeying the Commands of</hi> Leonidas; <hi>there remain'd only with the</hi> Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>the</hi> Thespians, <hi>and the</hi> Thebans; <hi>of these, the</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans <hi>stay'd against their Wills, for</hi> Leonidas <hi>retain'd them as Hostages; but the</hi> Thespians <hi>most willingly, as who said, they would never depart from</hi> Leonidas, <hi>and those that were with him.</hi> Does he not here manifestly discover himself to have a peculiar Pique and Hatred against the <hi>Thebans,</hi> by the Impulse of which he not only falsly and unjustly calumniated the City, but did not so much as take care to render his Contradiction probable, or to conceal, at
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46327:207"/> least from a few Men, his being conscious of having knowingly contradicted himself? For having before said, that <hi>Leonidas,</hi> perceiving his Confederates not to be in good Heart, nor prepared to undergo Danger, wish'd them to depart; he a little after adds, that the <hi>Thebans</hi> were, against their Wills, detain'd by him; whereas, if he had believ'd them inclin'd to the <hi>Medians,</hi> he should have driven them away, though they had been willing to tarry. For if he thought that those, who were not brisk, would be useless, to what purpose was it to mix among his Souldiers those, that were suspected? Nor was the King of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> and General of all <hi>Greece,</hi> so sensless as to think, that four hundred armed <hi>Thebans</hi> could be detain'd as Hostages, by his three hundred, especially the Enemy being both in his Front and Rear. For though at first he might have taken them along with him as Hostages; tis certainly probable, that at last having no regard for him, they would have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, and that <hi>Leonidas</hi> would have more fear'd being encompass'd by them, than by the Enemy. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, would not <hi>Leonidas</hi> have been ridiculous, to have sent away the other <hi>Greeks,</hi> as if by staying, they should soon after have dy'd, and to have detain'd the <hi>Thebans,</hi> that being himself about to dye, he might keep them for the <hi>Greeks?</hi> For if he had indeed carry'd them along with him for Hostages, or rather for Slaves, he should not have kept them with those, that were at the point to perish, but have deliver'd them to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that went away. There remain'd but one Cause, that might be alledg'd for <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s unwillingness to let them go, to wit, that they might dye with him, and this our Historian himself has taken away, writing thus of <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Ambition: Leonidas, <hi>considering these things, and desirous that this Glory might redound to the</hi> Spartans <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, sent away his Confederates rather for this, than because they differ'd in their Opinions.</hi> For it had certainly been the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:46327:208"/> height of Folly to keep his Enemies against their Wills, to be Partakers of that Glory, from which he drave away his Confederates. But 'tis manifest from the Effects, that, <hi>Leonidas</hi> suspected not the <hi>Thebans</hi> of Insincerity, but esteem'd them to be his stedfast Friends. For he march'd with his Army into <hi>Thebes,</hi> and at his request obtain'd that which was never granted to any other, to sleep within the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the next Morning related to the <hi>Thebans</hi> the Vision, that had appear'd to him. For he imagin'd, that he saw the most illustrious and greatest Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> irregularly toss'd, and float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down in a very stormy and tempestuous Sea; that <hi>Thebes,</hi> being carry'd above all the rest, was lifted up on high to Heaven, and suddenly after disappear'd. And this indeed had a Resemblance of those things, which long after befel that City. Now <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his Narration of that Fight, hath obscur'd also the brav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Act of <hi>Leonidas,</hi> saying, that they all fell in the Streights near <hi>Colonus.</hi> But the Affair was otherwise manag'd. For when they perceiv'd by Night, that they were emcompass'd by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> they march'd streight to the Enemies Camp, and got very near the Kings Pavilion, with a Resolution to kill him, and leave their Lives about him. They came then to his Tent, killing, or putting to slight all they met. But when <hi>Xerxes</hi> was not found there, seeking him in that vast Camp, and wandring about, they were at last with much difficulty slain by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them on every side. What other Acts and Sayings of the <hi>Spartans Herodotus</hi> has omitted, we will write in the Life of <hi>Leonidas.</hi> Yet that hinders not, but we may here set down also some few. Before <hi>Leonidas</hi> went forth to that War, the <hi>Spartans</hi> exhibited to him a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fight, at which the Fathers and Mothers of those who went along with him, were Spectators. <hi>Leonidas</hi> himself, when one said to him, <hi>You lead very few with you
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:46327:208"/> to the Battle:</hi> answered, <hi>They are many to dye there.</hi> When his Wife, at his Departure, ask'd him, what Commands he had for her; he turning to her, said, <hi>I command you to marry a good Man, and bring him good Children.</hi> After he was enclosed by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Who would not have blam'd another, that should have omitted these things? But he, who has collected and recorded the Fart of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masis,</hi> the coming of the Thiefs Asses, and the giving of Bottles, and many such like things, cannot seem to have omitted these gallant Acts, and these remarkable Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by Negligence and Oversight, but as bearing ill Will, and being unjust to some. He says, that the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> being at the first with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> fought, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by Necessity. For belike not only <hi>Xerxes,</hi> but <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onidas</hi> also, had Whipsters following his Camp, by whom the <hi>Thebans</hi> being scourg'd, were forc'd against their Wills to fight. And he says, that the fought upon Necessity, who might have gone away and fled; and that they inclin'd to the <hi>Medes,</hi> whereas not one came in to help them. After this, he writes, that the rest making to <hi>Colonus,</hi> the <hi>Thebans</hi> separated themselves from them, lifted up their Hands to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and coming near, cry'd with a most true Voice, that they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But yet how did the <hi>Thebans</hi> escape, the <hi>Thessalians</hi> helping them with their Testimony? <hi>Some of them,</hi> says he, <hi>were slain by the</hi> Barbarians. <hi>Many of them were by Command of</hi> Xerxes <hi>mark'd with the Royal Mark, beginning with their Leader</hi> Leontiades. Now the Captain of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> at <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> was not <hi>Leontiades,</hi> but <hi>Anaxander,</hi> as both <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> out of the Commentaries of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and <hi>Nicander</hi> the <hi>Colophonian</hi> have taught us. Nor did any Man, before <hi>Herodotus,</hi> know, that the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> were stigmatiz'd by <hi>Xerxes.</hi> For otherwise this would have been an excellent Plea for them against his Calumny, and this City might well have glory'd in these Marks, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> had punisht <hi>Leonidas</hi> and <hi>Leontiades</hi> as his greatest Enemies, having outrag'd the Body of the one when he was Dead, and caus'd the other to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, whilst living. But he, who makes the <hi>Barbarians</hi> Cruelty against <hi>Leonidas,</hi> when dead, a Sign, that he hated him most of all Men, when living; and yet says, that the <hi>Thebans,</hi> though favouring the <hi>Medes,</hi> were stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd by them at <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> and having been thus stigmatiz'd, again chearfully took their Parts at <hi>Platea,</hi> seems to me not unlike to <hi>Hippoclides,</hi> who being told, as he was dancing over the Tables at a Festival, that he had danc'd away the Truth, made answer, Hippoclides <hi>cares not for that.</hi>

               <p>In his Eighth Book, our Author says, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> being frighted, design'd to fly from <hi>Artemisium</hi> into

                  <hi>Greece,</hi> and that being requested by the <hi>Euboeans</hi> to stay a little, till they could dispose of their Wives and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, they regarded them not, till such time as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles,</hi> having taken Money of them, divided it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Eurybiades</hi> and <hi>Adimantus,</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> and that then they stay'd, and had a Sea-Fight with the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Yet <hi>Pindar,</hi> who was not a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of any of the Confederate Cities, but of one, that was suspected to take part with the <hi>Medians,</hi> having made mention of <hi>Artemisium,</hi> brake forth into this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation. <hi>[This is the Place] where the Sons of the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians <hi>laid the glorious Foundation of Liberty.</hi> But <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> by whom, as some will have it, <hi>Greece</hi> is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, makes that Victory a Work of Bribery and Theft, saying, that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> deceiv'd by their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who had to that end taken Money, fought against their Wills. Nor does he here put an end to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. All Men in a manner confess, that, although the <hi>Greeks</hi> got the better at Sea, they nevertheless abandon'd <hi>Artemisium</hi> to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> after they had receiv'd the News of the Overthrow at <hi>Thermopylae.</hi> For 'twas to no purpose for them to stay there, and keep the Sea, the War being already within <hi>Pylae,</hi> and <hi>Xerxes</hi> having pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd himself of the Avenues. But <hi>Herodotus</hi> makes the <hi>Greeks</hi> contriving to fly, before they heard any thing of <hi>Leonidas</hi>'s Death. For thus he says: <hi>But they, having been ill treated, and especially the</hi> Athenians, <hi>half of whose Ships were sorely shatter'd, consulted to take their</hi> Flight <hi>into</hi> Greece. But let him be permitted so to name, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reproach this Retreat of theirs before the Fight; for having before call'd it a <hi>Flight,</hi> he both now stiles it a <hi>Flight,</hi> and will again a little after term it a <hi>Flight;</hi> so bitterly does he adhere to this Word <hi>Flight. Presently after this</hi> [says he] <hi>there came to the</hi> Barbarians <hi>in a Pinnace a Man of</hi> Hestiaeae, <hi>who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with the</hi> Flight <hi>of the</hi> Grecians <hi>from</hi> Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misium.
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:46327:210"/>
                  <hi>They, because the thing seem'd incredible, kept the Messenger in Custody, and sent forth some light Gallies to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Truth.</hi> But what is this you say? That they fled as conquer'd, whom the Enemies after the Fight could not believe to have fled, as having got much the better? Is then this [a Fellow] fit to be believ'd, when he writes of any Man or City, who in one Word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives <hi>Greece</hi> of the Victory, throws down the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and pronounces the Inscriptions, they had set up to <hi>Diana</hi> on the East Side of <hi>Artemisium,</hi> to be nothing but Pride and vain Boasting? The Tenor of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription was, as follows.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>When <hi>Athens</hi> Youth had in a Naval Fight</l>
                  <l>All <hi>Asias</hi> Forces on this Sea o'rethrown,</l>
                  <l>And the <hi>Medes</hi> Army put to Flight,</l>
                  <l>Than which a greater scarce was ever known,</l>
                  <l>To shew, how much <hi>Diana</hi> they respected,</l>
                  <l>This Trophy to her Honour they erected.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Moreover, not having describ'd any Order of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor told us, what Place every City of theirs held during the Sea-fight, he says, that in this Retreat, which he calls their Flight, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> sail'd first, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> last. He indeed ought not to have too much insulted over the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that took part with the <hi>Medes,</hi> who, being by others thought a <hi>Thurian,</hi> reckons him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self among the <hi>Halicarnasseans,</hi> which, being <hi>Dorians</hi> by Descent, went with their Wives and Children to the War against the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But he is so far from giving first an Account of the Streights, they were in, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted to the <hi>Medes,</hi> that relating how the <hi>Thessalians</hi> sent to the <hi>Phocaeans,</hi> which were their mortal Enemies, and promis'd to preserve their Country free from all Dammage, if they might receive from them a Reward of fifty Talents, he writ thus of the <hi>Phocaeans: For the</hi> Phocaeans <hi>were the only People in these Quarters, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:46327:210"/> not to the</hi> Medians, <hi>and that, as far as I upon due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration can find, for no other Reason, but because they hated the</hi> Thessalians; <hi>for if the</hi> Thessalians <hi>had been affected to the</hi> Grecian <hi>Affairs, I suppose the</hi> Phocaeans <hi>would have joyn'd themselves to the</hi> Medes. And yet a little after he wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l say, that thirteen Cities of the <hi>Phocaeans</hi> were burnt by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> their Country laid wast, and the Temple, which was in <hi>Abes,</hi> set on fire, and all of both Sexes put to the Sword, except those, that by Flight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd to <hi>Parnassus.</hi> Nevertheless, he puts those, who suffered all Extremities, rather than they would lose their Honesty, in the same Rank with those, who most affectionately sided with the <hi>Medians.</hi> And when he could not blame the <hi>Phocaeans</hi> Actions, he devis'd false Causes, framing Suspicions against them with his Pen, and judging them, not by what they did, but by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, put on their Intentions by the <hi>Thessalians,</hi> who gap'd after their Dominions, as if they therefore refused to enter into the Treason, because others had prevented them. Now if any one, going about to excuse the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the <hi>Thessalians</hi> to the <hi>Medes,</hi> should say, that they would not have done it, but for the Hatred, they bare the <hi>Phocaeans,</hi> whom when they saw joyn'd to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they, against their Inclinations, followed the Party of the <hi>Medes;</hi> would not such an one be thought most shamefully to flatter, and for the Sake of others, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Truth, by feigning good Causes for evil Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Indeed, I think, he would, why then should not he be thought openly to calumniate, who says, that the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeans</hi> chose the best, not for the Love of Vertue, but because they saw the <hi>Thessalians</hi> on the contrary side? For neither does he refer this Device to other Authors, as he is elsewhere wont to do, but says, that himself found it out by Conjecture. He should therefore have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd certain Arguments, by which he was perswaded, that they, who did things like the best, followed the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:46327:211"/> same Counsels with the worst. For what he alledges of their Enmities, is ridiculous. For neither did the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>Aeginetae</hi> and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> nor that between the <hi>Chalcidians</hi> and the <hi>Eretrians,</hi> nor yet that between the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the <hi>Megarians,</hi> hinder them from fighting together for <hi>Greece.</hi> Nor did the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> their most bitter Enemies, plaguing the <hi>Thessali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> divert them from their Friendship with the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> For the common Danger did so bury their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Grudges, that banishing their other Pussions, they apply'd their Minds either to Honesty, for the Sake of Vertue, or to profit through the Impulse of Necessity. And indeed after that Necessity, which compell'd them to obey the <hi>Medians,</hi> was over, they return'd again to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as <hi>Laocrates</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> has openly testified of them. And <hi>Herodotus,</hi> as constrain'd to it, in his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Affairs at <hi>Plataeae,</hi> confess'd that the <hi>Phocaeans</hi> took part with the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Neither ought it to seem strange to any, if he thus bitterly inveighs against the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate; since he reckons amongst Enemies and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors those, who were present at the Engagement, and together with the other <hi>Greeks,</hi> hazarded their Safety. <hi>For the</hi> Naxians, says he, <hi>sent three Ships to the Assistance of the</hi> Barbarians, <hi>but</hi> Democritus, <hi>one of their Captains, perswaded the other two to take the Party of the</hi> Greeks. So unable he is to praise without dispraising, that if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends one Man, he must condemn a whole City or People. But in this there give Testimony against him, of the more ancient Writers, <hi>Hellanicus,</hi> and of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Ephorus,</hi> one of which says, that the <hi>Naxians</hi> came with six Ships to aid the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the other with five. And <hi>Herodotus</hi> convinces himself of having feign'd these things. For the Writers of the <hi>Naxian</hi> Annals say, that they had before beaten back <hi>Megabates,</hi> who came to their Island with two hundred Ships; and after that, put to flight the General <hi>Datis,</hi> who had set their City on
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:46327:211"/> Fire. Now if, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> has elsewhere said, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> burnt their City, so that the Men were glad to save themselves by flying into the Mountains; had they not just Cause rather to send Aid to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers of their Country, than to help the Protectors or the common Liberty? But that he fram'd this Lye, not so much to honor <hi>Democritus,</hi> as to cast Infamy on the <hi>Naxians,</hi> is manifest from his omitting and wholly passing over in Silence the valiant Acts then perform'd by <hi>Democritus,</hi> of which <hi>Simonides</hi> gives us an Account in this Epigram.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>When as the <hi>Greeks</hi> at Sea the <hi>Medes</hi> did meet,</l>
                  <l>And had neer <hi>Salamis</hi> a Naval Fight,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Democritus</hi> third time led up the Fleet,</l>
                  <l>Charging the Enemy with all his Might.</l>
                  <l>He took five of their Ships, and did another,</l>
                  <l>Which they had taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> recover.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But why should any one be angry with him about the <hi>Naxians?</hi> If we have as some say, <hi>Antipodes</hi> inhabiting the other Hemisphere; I believe, that they also have heard of <hi>Themistocles</hi> and his Counsel, which he gave the <hi>Greeks</hi> to fight a Naval Battel before <hi>Salamis,</hi> where the <hi>Barbarian</hi> being overcome, he built in <hi>Malta</hi> a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>Diana</hi> the Counsellor. This gentle Writer, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, as much as in him lies, to deprive <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of the Glory of this, and transfer it to another, writes thus Word for Word: <hi>Whilst things were thus,</hi> Mnesiphilus, <hi>an</hi> Athenian, <hi>askt</hi> Themistocles, <hi>as he was going aboard his Ship, what had been resolv'd on in Council. And being answer'd, that 'twas decreed, the Ships should be brought back to</hi> Isthmus, <hi>and a Battel fought at Sea before</hi> Peloponnesus; he said, <hi>If then they remove the Navy from</hi> Salamis, <hi>you,</hi> Themistocles, <hi>shall never fight for your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for they will every one return to his own City. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:46327:212"/> if there be any way left, go, and endeavour to break this Resolution, and if it be possible, perswade</hi> Euribyades <hi>to change his Mind and stay here.</hi> Then adding, that this Advice pleas'd <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who, without making any Reply, went streight to <hi>Euribyades,</hi> he has these very Expressions. <hi>And sitting by him, related, what he had heard from</hi> Mnesiphilus, <hi>feigning, as if it came from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and adding other things.</hi> You see how he accuses <hi>Themistocles</hi> of Disingenuity in arrogating to himself the Counsel of <hi>Mnesiphilus.</hi> And further deriding the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he says, that <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who was call'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> for his Wisdom, was so blind, that he could not foresee, what was fit to be done. But that <hi>Artemisia,</hi> who was of the same City with <hi>Herodotus,</hi> without being taught by any one, but by her own Consideration, said thus to <hi>Xerxes. The</hi> Greeks <hi>will not long be able to hold out against you; nor is it probable, if you march your Army by Land to</hi> Peloponnesus, <hi>that they will sit still, or take care to fight at Sea for the</hi> Athenians. <hi>But if you make hast to give them a Naval Battel, I fear, lest your Fleets receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dammage, may prove also very prejudicial to your Land-Forces.</hi> Certainly <hi>Herodotus</hi> wanted nothing but Verses to make <hi>Artemisia</hi> another <hi>Sibyl,</hi> so exactly prophesying of things to come. Therefore <hi>Xerxes</hi> also deliver'd his Children to her to be carry'd to <hi>Ephesus;</hi> for he had (it seems) forgot to bring Women with him from <hi>Susa,</hi> if indeed they wanted a Train of Female Attendants. But 'tis not our Design to search into the Lies of <hi>Herodotus;</hi> we only make inquiry into those, which he invented, to detract from the Glory of others. He says, 'tis report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that <hi>Adimantus,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> when the Enemies were now ready to joyn Battel, was struck with such Fear and Astonishment, that he fled; not thrusting his Ship backward at the Stern, or leisurely retreating through those, that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, but openly hoising up his Sails, and turning the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:46327:212"/> Heads of all his Vessels. And that about the farther part of the <hi>Salaminian</hi> Coast, he was met by a Pinnace, out of which one spake thus to him: <hi>Thou indeed,</hi> Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus, <hi>fly'st, having betray'd the</hi> Grecians, <hi>yet they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and according to their Desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es have the better of their Enemies.</hi> This Pinnace certainly was let down from Heaven. For what should hinder him from erecting a Tragical Machine, who by his Boasting excell'd the <hi>Tragaedians</hi> in all other things? <hi>Adimantus</hi> then crediting him, return'd to the Fleet, when the Business was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done. <hi>This Report,</hi> says he, <hi>is deliver'd by the</hi> Athenians; <hi>but the</hi> Corinthians <hi>deny it, and say, they were the first at the Sea-sight, for which they have the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all the other</hi> Greeks. Such is this Man in many other Places: He spreads different Calumnies and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of different Men, that he may not sail of making some one appear altogether Wicked; as it has succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well with him in this place: for if the Calumny is believ'd, the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> if it is not, the <hi>Athenians</hi> are rendred infamous, or else the <hi>Athenians</hi> did not bely the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but he has bely'd them both. Certainly <hi>Thucydides,</hi> bringing in an <hi>Athenian</hi> Ambassador, contest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a <hi>Corinthian</hi> at <hi>Sparta,</hi> and gloriously boasting of many things about the <hi>Median</hi> War, and the Sea-Fight at <hi>Salamis,</hi> charges not the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with any Crime of Treachery, or leaving their Station. Nor was it likely the <hi>Athenians</hi> should object any such thing against <hi>Corinth,</hi> when they saw it engraven in the third place after the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and themselves on those Spoils, which, being taken from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> were consecrated to the Gods. And in <hi>Salamis</hi> they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to bury their Dead near the City, as being Men, who had behav'd themselves gallantly, and to write over them this Elegy.</p>

               <p>These things he should rather have written, and recorded, than have inserted <hi>Aminocles</hi>'s Killing of his Son.

               </p>
               <p>In his ninth and last Book, having nothing left, to vent his Malice on but the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Action against the <hi>Barbarians</hi> at <hi>Plataeae,</hi> he writes, that the <hi>Spartans</hi> at first fear'd, lest the <hi>Athenians</hi> should suffer themselves to be perswaded by <hi>Mardonius,</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the other <hi>Greeks;</hi> but that now, the <hi>Isthmus</hi> being fortify'd, they, supposing all to be safe at <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> easily slighted the rest, Feasting and making merry at home, and deluding and delaying the <hi>Athenian</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. How then did there go forth from <hi>Sparta</hi> to <hi>Plateae</hi> a thousand and five Men, having every one of them with him seven <hi>Heilots?</hi> or how came it, that exposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to so many Dangers, they vanquisht and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw so many thousand <hi>Barbarians?</hi> Hear now his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Cause of it. It <hi>happen'd,</hi> says he, <hi>that there was then at</hi> Sparta <hi>a certain Stranger of</hi> Tegea, <hi>nam'd</hi> Chileus, <hi>who had some Friends amongst the</hi> Ephori, <hi>between whom and him there was mutual Hospitality: He then perswaded them to send f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now if any private Business had kept that <hi>Chileus</hi> at <hi>Tegea, Greece</hi> had never been victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Again, not knowing what to do with the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he tosses to and fro that City, sometimes extolling it, and sometimes debasing it. He says, that contending
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:46327:214"/> for the second Place with the <hi>Tegeates,</hi> they made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> alledg'd their Acts against the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazons,</hi> and the Sepulchres of the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> that dy'd under the Walls of <hi>Cadmeia,</hi> and at last brought down their Discourse to the Battel of <hi>Marathon,</hi> ambitiously desiring the Command of the left Wing. A little after he says, that <hi>Pausanias</hi> and the <hi>Spartans</hi> yielded them the first Place, desiring them to fight in the right Wing against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and give them the Left, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd themselves as not skill'd in fighting against the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Now 'tis a ridiculous thing to be willing to fight against no Enemy, unless one has been us'd to him. But he says farther, that the other <hi>Greeks</hi> being led by their Captains to encamp in another Place, as soon as they were mov'd, the Horse fled, not without Joy, towards <hi>Plataeae,</hi> and in their Flight came as far as <hi>Juno</hi>'s Temple. In which place indeed he charges them all in general with Disobedience, Cowardize and Treason. At last he says, that only the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and the <hi>Tegeates</hi> fought with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and the <hi>Athenians</hi> with the <hi>Thebans;</hi> equally defrauding all the other Cities of their Part in the Honour of the Victory; whilst he affirms, that none of them joyn'd in the Fight, but all of them, sitting still hard by in their Arms, betray'd and forsook those, who fought for them. That the <hi>Phliasians</hi> and <hi>Megarians</hi> indeed; when they heard, <hi>Pausanias</hi> had got the better, came in, and falling rashly on the <hi>Theban</hi> Horse, were cut off: that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not at the Battel; but, after the Victory was got, making hast through the Hills, they escap'd the <hi>Theban</hi> Cavalry. For the <hi>Thebans,</hi> after the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were overthrown, going before with their Horse, affectionately assisted them in their Flight, to return them Thanks (forsooth) for the Marks, they had stigmatiz'd them with at <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopylae.</hi> Now what Rank the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had in the Fight at <hi>Plataeae</hi> against the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and how they
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:46327:215"/> perform'd their Duty, you may hear from <hi>Simonides</hi> in these Verses.</p>

For these are his Words. <hi>As for the other Sepulchres that are seen in</hi> Plateae, <hi>I have heard, that their Successors, being asham'd of their Progenitors Absence from this Battel, erected every Man a Monument for Posterities Sake.</hi> Of this treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Deserting the Battel, <hi>Herodotus</hi> was the only Man, that ever heard. For the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Battel, deceiv'd <hi>Pausanias, Aristides,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Neither yet did the <hi>Athenians</hi> exclude the <hi>Aeginetae,</hi> who were their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, from the inscription, nor convince the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of having fled from <hi>Salamis</hi> before the Victory, <hi>Greece</hi> bearing Witness to the contrary.

               <p>Did <hi>Cleadas</hi> also, O <hi>Herodotus,</hi> or some other, write this, to oblige the Cities by Flattery? What need had they then to employ fruitless Labor in digging up the Earth, to make Tombs, and erect Monuments for Posterities Sake, when they saw their Glory consecrated in the most il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious and greatest Donaries? <hi>Pausanias</hi> indeed, when he was now aspiring to the Tyranny, set up this Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Delphos.</hi>

                  <l>

                  <l>When he the <hi>Medes</hi> in Fight had overthrown,</l>
                  <l>Offer'd to <hi>Phaebus</hi> a Memorial</l>

               </q>
               <p>In which he gave the Glory to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whose Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral he profess'd himself. Yet the <hi>Greeks</hi> not enduring, but utterly misliking it, the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> sending to <hi>Delphos,</hi> caus'd this to be cut out, and the Names of the Cities, as it was fit, to be engraven instead of it. Now how is it probable, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> should have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that there was no mention made of them in the Inscription, if they had been conscious to themselves of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:46327:216"/> deserting the Fight? or that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> would have eras'd the Name of their Leader and General, to insert Deserters, and such as withdrew themselves from the common Danger? For it would have been a great Indignity, that <hi>Sochares, Deipnistus,</hi> and all the rest, who shew'd their Valor in that Fight, should calmly suffer the <hi>Cythnians</hi> and <hi>Melians</hi> to be inscrib'd on the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees; and that <hi>Herodotus,</hi> attributing that Fight only to three Cities, should erase all the rest out of those and other Sacred Monuments and Donaries. For there hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been then four Fights with the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> he says, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> fled from <hi>Artemisium;</hi> that, whilst their King and General expos'd himself to Danger at <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopylae,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> sat negligent at Home, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the <hi>Olympian</hi> and <hi>Carnean</hi> Feasts. And discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Action at <hi>Salamis,</hi> he uses more Words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Artemisia,</hi> than he does in his whole Narrative of the Naval Battel. Lastly, he says, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> sate still at <hi>Plataeae,</hi> knowing no more of the Fight, till it was over, than if it had been a Skirmish between Mice and Frogs, in which, as <hi>Pigres, Artemisias</hi>'s Brother, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and scoffingly said, it had been agreed to fight si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, lest they should be heard by others; and that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> excell'd not the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in Valor, but only got the better, as fighting against naked and unarm'd Men. To wit, when <hi>Xerxes</hi> himself was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were with much difficulty compell'd by Scourges to fight with the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but at <hi>Plataeae,</hi> having taken other Resolutions, they were no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior in Courage and Strength; but their Garments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Armour, was prejudicial to them, since be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked, they fought against a compleatly arm'd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. What then is there left great and memorable to the <hi>Grecians</hi> of those Fights, if the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> fought with unarm'd Men, the other <hi>Greeks,</hi> though present, were ignorant of the Battel, empty Monuments are set
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:46327:216"/> up every where, and <hi>Tripuses</hi> and Altars, full of lying Inscriptions, plac'd before the Gods: if lastly, <hi>Herodotus</hi> only knows the Truth, all others, that give any Account of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> being deceiv'd by the Fame of those Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Effects of an admirable Prowess?</p>

                  <p>You, O <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> seem not much to care, if any one thinks, that you philosophize against the common Notions; since you confess, that you contemn also the Senses, from whence the most part of these Notions in a manner proceed, having for their Seat and Foundation the Belief of such things, as appear to us. But I beseech you, with what speed you can, either by Reasons, Incantations, or some other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Discourse, to cure me, who come to you, full, as I seem to my self, of great and strange Perturbation: so much have I been shaken, and into such a Perplexity of Mind have I been brought by certain <hi>Stoicks,</hi> in other things indeed very good Men, and my familiar Friends, but most bitterly and hostilely bent against the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. These for some few Words, modestly spoken by me, have (for I will tell you no Ly) rudely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly reprehended me; angrily calling and reputing the Ancients Sophisters, Corrupters and Subverters of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:46327:217"/> those that walk in the way of Doctrines, and saying yet things more absurd than these, they fell at last upon the Conceptions, as into which the <hi>Academicks</hi> had brought a certain Confusion and Disturbance. At length one of them said, that he thought, it was not by Fortune, but by the Providence of the Gods, that <hi>Chrysippus</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World after <hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> and before <hi>Carneades;</hi> of which the one was the Author of the Contumelies and Injuries done to Custom; and the other flourisht most of all in the <hi>Academicks. Chrysippus</hi> then, coming between them, by his Writings against <hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> stopp'd also the way against the Eloquence of <hi>Carreades,</hi> leaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many things to the Senses, as Provision against a Siege; but wholly taking away the Trouble about An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipations and Conceptions, directing every one of them, and putting it in its proper Place: that they, who will again embroil and disquiet Matters, cannot but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of being Malicious and Deceitful Sophisters. I, having been this Morning set on Fire by these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, want some cooling Remedies to extinguish and take away this Doubting, as an Inflammation, out of my Mind.</p>

                  <p>You perhaps have suffer'd the same things with some of the Vulgar. But if you believe the Poets, who say, that the ancient [City] <hi>Sipilus</hi> was overthrown by the Providence of the Gods, when they punisht <hi>Tantalus:</hi> believe also the Companions of the <hi>Stoa,</hi> [saying] that Nature, not by Chance, but by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, brought forth <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> when she had a mind to turn things upside down, and alter the Course of Life; for which purpose, never any Man was fitter than he. But as <hi>Cato</hi> said of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that never any [but he] came to the [Management of] Publick Affairs, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and considerately resolv'd on the Ruine of the State: so does this Man seem to me, with the greatest Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Eloqence, to overturn and demolish Custom;
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:46327:218"/> and that do they, who magnifie the Man, testifie, when they dispute against him concerning [the Sophism] call'd <hi>Pseudomenos</hi> [or the <hi>Liar.</hi>] For to say, my best Friend, that a Conclusion, drawn from contrary Positions, is not manifestly false; and again to say, that some Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, having true premises, and true Inductions, may yet moreover have the contrary to their Conclusions true; what Conception at Demonstration, or what Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith does it not overthrow? They say, that the <hi>Polypus</hi> in the Winter gnaws his own Claws and pendant hairy Feet: But the Logick of <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away and cutting off its own chiefest Parts and Principles; What other Notion has it left unsuspected of Fasthood? For the Superstructures cannot be steady and sure, if the Foundations remain not firm, but are shaken with so many Doubts and Troubles. But as those, who have Dust or Dirt upon their Bodies, if they touch or rub the Filth, that is upon them, seem rather to increase than remove it: so some Men blame the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademicks,</hi> and think them guilty of the Faults, with which they shew themselves to be burden'd. For which of these do at length more pervert the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception?

                  <speaker>Diadumenus.</speaker>
                  <p>First then consider this, whether, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Conceptions, they [can be said to] agree with Nature, who think [all] natural things indifferent, and esteem neither Health, Vigorousness of Complexion, Beauty, nor Strength desirable, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, profitable, or any way contributary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of natural Perfection? Nor that their Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as Maims, Pains, Disgraces, and Diseases, are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or to be shunn'd. To the latter of which, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves say, that Nature gives us an Abhorrence, and an Inclination to the former. Which very thing is not a little repugnant to common Understanding: that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should incline us to such things, as are neither good nor available, and avert us from such, as are neither ill, nor hurtful; and which is more, that she should render this Inclination and this Aversion so violent, that they, who either possess not the one, or fall into the other, with good Reason detest their Life, and withdraw themselves out of it. I think also, that this is said by them against common Sense, that Nature her self is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and yet that 'tis good to agree with Nature. For 'tis not our Duty, either to follow the Law, or be perswaded by Argument, unless the Law and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be good and honest. And this indeed is the least
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46327:219"/>
[of their Errors.] But if, as <hi>Chrysippus</hi> has written in his first Book concerning Exhortation, an happy Life consists only in living according to Vertue, other things, as he says, being nothing to us, nor cooperating any way towards it, Nature is not only indifferent, but foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish also and stupid, in inclining us to such things, as belong nothing to us; and we also are fools in thinking Felicity to be an agreeing with Nature, which draws us after such things, as contribute nothing to Happiness. For what can be more agreeable to common Sense, than that, as desirable things are requisite to live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously, so natural things are necessary, that we may live according to Nature. Now these Men say not so; but having setled the Living according to Nature for their End, do nevertheless hold those things, which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature, to be indifferent. Nor is this less repugnant to common Sense, that an intelligent and prudent Man should not be equally affected to equal good things; but should put no value on some, and be ready to undergo and suffer any thing for others, though the things themselves are neither greater nor less one than another. For they say, 'tis the same thing to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from the Enjoyment of an old Woman, that has one foot in the Grave, [and to venture ones Life in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ones Country:] since both do, what their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires. And yet for this, as a great and glorious thing, they should be ready to dye; when as to boast of the other, would be shameful and ridiculous. And even <hi>Chrysippus</hi> himself in his Commentary concerning <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and third Book of the Gods, says, that 'twere a poor, absur'd, and impertinent thing to glory in such Acts, as proceeding from Vertue, as are to bear valiantly the Stinging of a Wasp, or to abstain chastly from an old Woman, that lies a dying. Do not they then philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize against the common Conception, who profess no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be more commendable than those things, which
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46327:219"/> yet themselves are asham'd to praise? For how can that be desirable, or to be approv'd, which is worthy neither of Praise nor Admiration; but the Praisers and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of which, they esteem absurd and ridiculous? And yet this will (I suppose) appear to you more against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense, that a wise Man should take no care, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he enjoys, or not enjoys the greatest good things, but should carry himself after the same manner in these things, as in those, that are indifferent, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and Administration of them. For all of us, whoever we are, <hi>that eat the Fruits of the Earth,</hi> judge that desirable, good, and profitable, which, being present, we use, and absent, we want and desire. But that, which no Man thinks worth his Concern, either for his Profit, or Delight, is indifferent. For we by no other means distinguish a laborious Man from a Trifler, who is for the most part also employ'd in Action, but that the one busies himself in useless Matters and indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the other in things commodious and profitable. But these Men act quite contrary: for with them, a wise and prudent Man, being conversant in many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions and Memories of Comprehensions, esteems few of them to belong to him, and not caring for the rest, thinks he has neither more or less by remembring, that he la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ely had the Comprehension [or certain Knowledge] of <hi>Dion</hi> sneezing, or <hi>Theon</hi> playing at Ball, although every Comprehension in a wise Man, and every Memory, having Assurance and Firmness, is a great, yea, a very great Good. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Health fails, when some Organ of his Senses is disorder'd, or when his Wealth is lost, is a wise Man so careless, as to think, that none of these things concerns him? Or does he, when sick, give Fees to the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? for the gaining of Riches sail to <hi>Leucon,</hi> Governor in the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> or travel to <hi>Indathyrsus,</hi> King of the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> as <hi>Chrysippus</hi> says? and being depriv'd of some
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:46327:220"/> of his Senses, grow weary even of Life? How then do they not acknowledge, that they philosophize against the common Notions, employing so much Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence on things indifferent, and carrying themselves indifferently, when they either have, or have not great good things?</p>
                  <p>But this also is yet against the common Conceptions, that he, who is a Man, should not rejoyce, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the greatest Evils to the greatest Goods. Now their wise Man suffers this. For being chang'd from extream Vitiousness to the highest Vertue, and at the same time escaping a most miserable Life, and attaining to a most happy one, he shews no sign of Joy, nor does this so great Change lift him up, or yet move him, being deliver'd from all Infelicity and Vice, and coming to a certain sure and firm Perfection of Vertue. This also is repugnant to common Sense, that the being Immutable in ones Judgments and Resolutions, is the greatest of Goods, and yet, that he, who has attain'd to the height, wants not this, nor cares for it, when he has it; nay, many times will not so much as stretch forth a Finger for this Security and Constancy, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless themselves esteem the Soveraign and perfect Good. Nor do the <hi>Stoicks</hi> only say these things, but [add] also this to them, that the continuance of Time encreases not any good thing; but that, if a Man shall be wise but a minute of an hour, he will not be any way inferior in Happiness to him, who has all his time practis'd Vertue, and led his Life happily in it. Yet, whilst they thus boldly affirm these things, they on the contrary also say, that a short-liv'd Vertue is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth: for what Advantage would the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Wisdom be to him, who is immediately to be swallow'd up by the Wave, or tumbled down headlong from a Precipice? What would it have benefited <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas,</hi> if, being thrown by <hi>Hercules,</hi> as from a Sling into
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:46327:220"/> the Sea, he had been on a sudden chang'd from Vice to Vertue? These therefore are the Positions of Men, who not only philosophize against the common Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but also confound their own; if the having been but a little while endu'd with Vertue is no way short of the highest Felicity, and at the same time nothing worth. Nor is this the strangest thing, you will find in their Doctrine, but their being of Opinion, that Vertue and Happiness, when present, are frequently not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by him, who enjoys them; nor does he discern, that having but a little before been most miserable and foolish, he is of a sudden become wise and happy. For 'tis not only childish to say, that he, who is possess'd of Wisdom, is ignorant of this thing alone, that he is wise, and knows not that he is deliver'd from Folly; but, to speak in general, they make Goodness to have very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Weight or Strength, if it does not give so much as a Feeling of it, when 'tis present: for, according even to them, 'tis not by Nature imperceptible; nay, even <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus</hi> in his [Books] <hi>Of the End,</hi> expresly says, that Good is sensible, as he thinks, and demonstrates. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then, that by its weakness and littleness it flies the Sense, when being present, 'tis unknown and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from the Possessors. 'Twere moreover absurd [to imagin] that the Sight, perceiving those things, which are but a little whitish, or inclining to white, should not discern such as are white in perfection, or that the Touch, feeling those things, which are but warm, or moderately hot, should be insensible of those, that are hot in the highest degree. And yet more absurd it is, that a Man, who perceives, what is commonly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Nature, as are Health and good Constitution of Body, should yet be ignorant of Vertue, when it is present, which themselves hold to be most of all, and in the highest degree according to Nature. For how can it but be against Sense, to conceive the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:46327:221"/> Health and Sickness, [and so little to comprehend that between Wisdom] and Folly, as to think, the one to be present, when it is gone, and possessing the other, to be ignorant, that one has it? Now because there is from the Highest Progress a Change made to Felicity and Vertue, one of these two things must of necessity follow; either that this Progress is not Vice and Infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; or that Vertue is not far distant from Vice, nor Happiness from Misery; but that the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Good and Evil is very small, and not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by Sense: for otherwise they, who have the one for the other, could not be ignorant of it. Since then they will not depart from any of these Contrarieties, but confess, and hold them all. That those, who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding towards Vertue, are Fools and vitious; that those, who are become Good and Wise, perceive not this Change in themselves; and that there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Folly and Wisdom, do they not seem to you wonderfully to preserve an Agreement in their Doctrines?</p>
                  <p>[Now if in their Doctrines they are repugnant to Common Sense, and contradictory to themselves] they are yet more so in their [Negotiations and] Affairs, when affirming all Men, who are not wise, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually wicked, unjust, faithless and Fools, they on the otherside abhor and detest some of them, nay, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to such a Degree, that they refuse even to speak to them when they meet them; and others of them, they trust with their Money, choose to Offices, and take for Husbands to their Daughters. Now if they say these things in jest, let them smooth their Brows; but if in earnest, and as Philosophers, 'tis against the common. Notions, to reprove and blame all Men alike in Words, and yet to deal with some of them, as moderate Person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and with others, as very wicked: and exceedingly to admire <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> to deride <hi>Alexinus,</hi> and yet to think
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:46327:221"/> neither of them more or less mad than the other. 'Tis so, say they; but as he, who is not above a Cubit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Superficies of the Sea, is no less drown'd, than he, who is five hundred Fathom deep: so they, that are coming towards Vertue, are no less in Vice, than those, that are farther off: and as blind Men are still blind, though they shall perhaps a little after recover their Sight: so those, that have proceeded towards Vertue, till such time as they have attain'd to it, continue foolish and wicked. But that they, who are in the way towards Vertue, resemble not the Blind, but such, as see less clearly, nor are like to those, who are drown'd, but to those, which swim, and that near the Harbor, they themselves testifie by their Actions. For they would not use Counsellors, and Generals, and Law-givers, as blind Men do Guides; nor would imitate the Works, and Actions, and Words, and Lives of some, if they saw them all equally drown'd in Folly and Wickedness.</p>
                  <p>But leaving this, wonder at the Men in this behalf, that they are not taught by their own Examples, to let alone these wise Men, who are ignorant of themselves, and neither know, nor are sensible, that they are reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from boing drown'd, and see the Light, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gotten above Vice, fetch Breath again. This also is against common Sense, that it should be convenient for a Man, who has all good things, and wants nothing [re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite] to Felicity and Happpiness, to make away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and much more this, that for him, who neither has, nor ever shall have any good thing, but who is, and ever shall be accompany'd with all Adversities, Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Mishaps, it should not be fitting to quit this Life, unless some of the indifferent things befall him. These Laws are enacted in the <hi>Stoa,</hi> and by these they incite many wise Men [to kill themselves] as who shall be thereby more happy. Although the wise Man is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, blessed, every way happy, secure, and free
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:46327:222"/> from Danger; but the vitious and foolish Man, full, as I may say, of Wickedness, so that there is not room to put them in; and yet they think, that continuing in Life is fit for the latter, and departing out of it only for the former. And not without cause, <hi>says Chrysippus,</hi> for we are not to measure Life by good things or evil, but by those, that are according to Nature. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do they maintain Custom, and philosophize accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common Conceptions. What do you say? Ought not he, who enters upon a Deliberation of Life and Death, to consider,
<q>What Good or Ill in his own House there is?</q> Should he not weigh, as in a Ballance, what things have the greatest Sign of serving to Felicity or Infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? But argue, whether he should live or dye, from those things, which are neither profitable nor prejudicial? and follow such Principles and Sentences, as command the choosing of a Life full of all things, to be avoided, and the shunning of one, which wants nothing of all those things, that are desirable? For though 'tis an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd thing, Friend <hi>Lamprias,</hi> to shun a Life, in which there is no Evil; 'tis yet more absurd, if any one should leave what is good, because he is not possess'd of what is indifferent, as these Men do, who leave present Felicity and Vertue for want of Riches and Health, which they have not.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Saturnian Jove</hi> from <hi>Glaucus</hi> took his Wits,</q>
                  <p>When he went about to change his Suit of golden Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor for a brasen one, and to give, what was worth an hundred Oxen, for that, which was worth but nine; and yet the brasen Armor was no less useful for Fight than the golden: Whereas Beauty and Health of Body, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> say, contribute not the least Advantage or Help towards Felicity; and yet they are willing to take
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:46327:222"/> Health in exchange for Wisdom. For they say, it would well enough have become <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Pherecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> to have parted with their Vertue and Wisdom, if the one of them could have thereby been freed from his low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Disease, and the other from his Dropsie. And if <hi>Circe</hi> had us'd two sorts of Magical Drinks, one to make wise Men Fools, and the other to make Fools wise *** <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> [would have done well] rather to have drank that of Folly, than to have chang'd his [Human] Shape for the Form of a Beast, though having with it Wisdom, and consequentially also Happiness. And they say, that Wisdom it self dictates to them these things, exhorting them thus: <hi>Let me go, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue not my being lost, If I must be carry'd about in the Shape of an Ass.</hi> But this, will some say, is an Ass-like Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which teaches thus: since to be wise and enjoy Felicity is good, and to wear the Shape [of an Ass] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. They say, there is a Nation of the <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> where a Dog reigns, is call'd King, and has all regal Honors and Services done to him; but Men exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Offices of Magistrates and Governors of Cities. Do not the <hi>Stoicks</hi> act in the very same manner? They give the Name and Apparence of Good to Vertue, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it alone is desirable, profitable, and available; but in the mean time they act these things, they philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophize, they live and die, as at the Command of things indifferent. And yet none of the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> kills that Dog; but he sits in State, and is rever'd by all. But these Men destroy and corrupt their Vertue, that they may obtain Health and Riches.</p>
                  <p>But the Corollary, which <hi>Chrysippus</hi> himself has given for a Conclusion to his Doctrines, seems to free us from the Trouble of saying any thing more about it. <hi>For there being,</hi> says he, <hi>in Nature some things good, some things bad, and some things between them both, which we call indifferent, there is no Man, but would rather have the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46327:223"/> Good than the Indifferent, and the Indifferent than the Bad.</hi> And of this we call the Gods to witness, begging of them by our Prayers, principally the Possession of good things; and, if that may not be, Deliverance from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; not desiring that, which is neither good nor bad, instead of Good; but willing to have it instead of Evil. But this Man, changing Nature, and inverting its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, removes the middle out of its own place into the last, and brings back the last into the middle; not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to those Tyrants, who give the first Place to the Wicked; and giving us a Law, first to seek for the Good, and secondly, the Evil, and lastly, to judge that worst, which is neither Good nor Evil; as if any one should place Infernal things next to Coelestial, thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth and earthly things into <hi>Tartarus,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Where very far from hence, deep under Ground,</l>
                        <l>Lies a vast Gulf—</l>
                     </q> Having therefore said in his third Book, that 'tis more expedient for a Fool to live, than not, though he should never attain to Wisdom, he adde these Words: <hi>For such are the good things of Men, that even evil things do in a manner precede others in the middle place. Not that these things themselves really precede; but Reason, which makes us choose rather to live, though we are to be Fools: therefore also, though unjust, wicked, hated of the Gods, and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>appy; for none of these things are absent from those, that live foolishly. Is it them convenient rather to live miserably, than not to live miserably, and better to be hurt, than not hurt; to be unjust, than not unjust; to break the Laws, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> to break them? That is, is it convenient to do things than are not convenient, and a Duty to live even against Duty? Yes indeed, for 'tis worse to mans Sense and Reason, than to be a Fool.</hi> What then all them, that they will not confess that to be Evil, which is worse than Evil?
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:46327:223"/> Why do they say, that Folly alone is to be avoided, if 'tis not less, but rather more convenient, to shun that Disposition, which is not capable of Folly?</p>
                  <p>But who can complain of this, that shall remember what he has written in his Second Book <hi>of Nature,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that Vice was not unprofitably made for the Universe. But 'tis meet, I should set down his Doctrine in his own Words, that you may understand, in what place those rank Vice, and what Discourses they hold of it, who accuse <hi>Xenocrates</hi> and <hi>Spensippus</hi> for not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, Health indifferent, and Riches useless. <hi>Vice,</hi> says he, <hi>has its Limit in reference to other Accidents. For 'tis also in some sort according to the Reason of Nature, and, as I may so say, is not wholly useless in respect of the Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, for otherwise also there would not be any Good.</hi> Is there then no Good among the Gods, because there is no Evil? And when <hi>Jupiter,</hi> having resolv'd all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into himself, shall be alone, other Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, will there then be no Good, because there will be no Evil? But [is it true, that] there is Melody in a Quire, though none in it sings faultily? and Health in the Body, tho no Member is sick? and yet cannot Vertue have its Existence without Vice? But as the Poyson of a Serpent, on the Gall of an Hyena, is to be mixt with some Medicures: was it also of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, that there must have been some Conjunction of the Wickedness of <hi>Melitus,</hi> with the Justice of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and the Dissoluteness of <hi>Cleon,</hi> with the Probity of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles?</hi> And could not <hi>Jupiter</hi> have found a Means to bring into the World <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> if he had not also made for us <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> and <hi>Phalaris?</hi> 'Tis now time for them to say, that the Consumption was made for the sound Constitution of Mens Bodies, and the Gout for the Swiftness of their Feet; and that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> would not have had a good Head of Hair, if <hi>Thersites</hi> had not been bald. For what difference is
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:46327:224"/> there between such Triflers and Ravers, and those, who say, that Intemperance was not brought forth unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for Continence, nor Injustice for Justice? that so we may pray to the Gods, there may always be Wickedness,
<q>Lies, fawning Speeches, and deceitful Manners:</q> If these being taken away, Vertue will also vanish and be lost.</p>
                  <p>Or do you desire to understand the greatest Sweetness of his Eloquence and Perswasion? For, says he, <hi>As Comedies have in them sometimes ridiculous Epigrams, which, though bad in themselves, give nevertheless a certain Grace to the whole Poem: so, though you may blame Vice in it self, yet is it not useless to other things.</hi> First then [to say] that Vice was made by the Providence of God, as a wanton Epigram by the will of the Poet, transcends in Absurdity all Imagination. For this being granted, how will the Gods be rather Givers of Good than Evil? How will Wickedness be displeasing to them, and hated by them? And what shall we have to oppose against these ill-sounding Sentences of the Poets?</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—A Cause to Men God sends,</l>
                     <l>When to chastise some House his Wrath intends?</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And again,
<q>What God these Seeds of Strife 'twixt them did sow.</q> Moreover, a lewd Epigram adorns the adorns the Comedy, and contributes to its End, which is to delight the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and make them laugh? But <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who is Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Fatherly, Supreme, Just,</hi> and, as <hi>Pindarus</hi> has it, <hi>the most perfect Artist,</hi> framing the World, not as a great Enterlude, full of Variety, and great Learning; but
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:46327:224"/> as a common City of Gods and Men, living together in Concord and Happiness with Justice and Vertue. What need had he, for the attaining to this excellent End, of Thieves, Murderers, Parricides and Tyrants? For Vice entred not as a Morisk dance, pleasing and delightful to the Divinity; nor was brought in amongst the Affairs of Men, for to cause Mirth and Laughter by its Railery and Facetiousness, since there is not to be seen in it so much as a Dream of that celebrated Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment [with Nature.] Besides, that foolish Epigram is a very small part of the Poem, and takes up but a very little Place in the Comedy; neither do such things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in it, nor do they corrupt any of those things, which seem to have been well done, or spoil their Grace. But all [Human] Affairs are repleat with Vice, and the whole Life from the very Prologue and Beginning to the End, being disorder'd, deprav'd, and disturb'd, and having no part of it pure, or inreprehensible, as these Men say, is the most filthy and most unpleasant of all Farces. Wherefore I would willingly ask, in what Vice is profitable to the Universe. Not surely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of heavenly things, and such, as are Divine by Nature: for 'twould be ridiculous [to say] that, if there had not arisen, or were not amongst Men, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and Covetousness, and Lying, or that, if we did not Rob, Plunder, Slander, and Murther one another, the Sun would not run his appointed Course, the World enjoy its Seasons and Periods of Time, or the Earth, which is seated in the midst of the Universe, afford the Principles of Wind and Rain. It remains then, that the Existence of Vice must be profitable for us and our Affairs; and that perhaps these Men mean. Are we then more healthy for being vicious, or do we more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with Necessaries? or does Vice contribute any thing to our Beauty or Strength? They say, No. Is it then only a Name of Silence, and a visionary Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:46327:225"/> of the Night-walking Sophisters, not lying above all things, and conspicuous to all, as Vice, so that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not partake of any thing, as unprofitable; but least, O ye Gods! of Vertue, for which we were created? Is it not then absurd, that the Utensils of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mariner, and Carter, should be serviceable and aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards his intended End, whilst that, which was by God made for Vertue, destroys and corrupts Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? But perhaps 'tis time now to leave this Point, and pass to another.</p>

                  <p>It is indeed, Sir, a thing worth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They babble indeed much; but in conclusion they say, that Prudence, being the Knowledge of Good and Evil ** and be wholly taken away: For, as, if there are Truths, 'tis impossible, but there must be some Lies also near to them: so it stands with Reason, that, if there are good things, there must also be evill things.</p>

                  <speaker>Lamprias.</speaker>
                  <p>One of these things indeed is not said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss. And I think also, that the other is not unappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by me. For I see a Difference [shewing] why that, which is not true, must immediately be false; but that is not of necessity presently Evil, which is not Good: because that between True and False there is no Medium; but between Good and Evil there is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. Nor is it of necessity, that the one must subsist with the other: for Nature may have Good without having any need of Evil, but only of that, which is neither Good nor Evil. But if there is any thing said by you to the former Reason, let us hear it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Diadumenus.</speaker>
                  <p>Many things indeed are said; but at present we shall make use only of what is most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:46327:225"/> In the first place, 'tis a Folly to imagine, that Good and Evil have their Existence for the Sake of Prudence: for, Good and Evil being already extant, Prudence came afterwards: as the Art of Physick was invented, there being already things wholsome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome. For Good and Evil are not therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, that there may be Prudence: But the Faculty, by which we judge between Good and Evil, that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in being, is named Prudence. As Sight is a Sence, distinguishing White from Black: which Colors were not therefore made, that we might have Sight; but we rather wanted Sight, to discern these things. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the World shall, as they hold, be set on Fire, there will then no Evil be left; but all will then be prudent and wise. There is therefore Prudence, though there is no Evil: nor is it of necessity for Evil to exist, that Prudence may have a Being. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, that Prudence must always be a Knowledge of Good and Evil, what Inconvenience would it be, if, Evil being taken away, Prudence should no longer sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist; but instead of this we should have another Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, not being the Knowledge of Good and Evil, but of Good only? So, if Black should be wholly lost from among the Colors, and any one should therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that Sight also is lost, for that 'tis not the Sense of [discerning] Black and White: what should hinder us from answering him? 'Tis no Prejudice to us, If we have not, what you call Sight, but in lieu of that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Sense and Faculty, by which we apprehend Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that are White and not White. For I indeed think, that neither our Taste would be lost, if bitter things were wanting, nor our Feeling, if Pain were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, nor Prudence, if Evil had no Being; but that these Senses would remain, to apprehend things sweet and grateful, and those that are not so, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be the Science of things Good and not Good.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:46327:226"/> But let those, who think otherwise, take the Name to themselves, leaving us the Thing. Besides all this, what should hinder, but there may be an Understanding of Evil, and an Existence of Good? As the Gods, I believe, enjoy Health, but understand the Feaver and Pleurisie. Since even we, who, as they say, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Evils, but no Good, are not yet destitute of the Knowledge, what Prudence, what Goodness, and what Happiness is. And this also is to be admir'd, that, Vertue being absent, there should be those, who can teach us, what it is, and give us a Comprehension of it; but [Vice] not being extant, it should be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to have any Understanding of it.</p>
                  <p>For see, what these Men perswade us, who Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophize against the Conceptions, that by Folly indeed we comprehend Prudence; but Prudence without Folly cannot so much as comprehend Folly it self. And if Nature had absolutely stood in need of the Generation of Evil, yet might one or two Examples of Vice have been sufficient; or if you will, it might have been requisite, that ten, a thousand, or ten thousand viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men should be brought forth, and not, that the Multitude of Vices should be so great, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in Number the Sands of the Sea, the Dust of the Earth, and the Feathers of all the various kinds of Birds in the World; and yet, that there should not be so much all this while, as a Dream of Vertue. Those, who in <hi>Sparta</hi> had the Charge of the [publick Halls or Eating-places, call'd] <hi>Phiditia,</hi> were wont to bring forth two or three <hi>Heilots,</hi> drunken and full of Wine, that the young Men, seeing what Drunkenness was, might learn to keep Sobriety. But in Human Life there are many such Examples of Vice For there is not any one sober to Vertue; but we all stagger up and down, acting shamefully, and living miserably. Thus does Reason inebriate us, and with
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:46327:226"/> so much Trouble and Madness does it fill us, that we fall in nothing short of those Dogs, of whom <hi>Aesop</hi> says, that seeing certain Skins swim on the Sea, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd to drink it up, but burst, before they could get at them. For Reason also, by which we hope to gain Reputation, and attain to Vertue, does, e're we can reach to it, corrupt and destroy us, being before fill'd with abundance of heady and bitter Vice. If indeed, as these Men say, they who are got even to the uppermost Step, have no Ease, Cessation, or Breathing from Folly and Infelicity.</p>
                  <p>But let us see, what manner of thing he shews Vice to be, who says, that 'twas not brought forth unprofitably, and of what use he makes it to be to those, who have it: writing in his Book, <hi>Of perfect Offices,</hi> that a wicked Man wants Nothing, has need of Nothing: Nothing is useful to him, Nothing proper, Nothing fit for him. How then is Vice useful, with which, neither Health, nor abundance of Riches, nor Advancement [in Vertue] is profitable? Does then none want these things, of which some are precedent and preferrable, and therefore useful, and others according to Nature, as themselves term them? Has none need of them, unless he become Wise? Does neither the vitious Man stand in need of being made Wise? Nor are Men hungry and thirsty, before they become Wise? The Thirsty then have no need of Water, nor the Hungry of Bread: like those courteous Guests, who requested only Shelter and Fire. So he had no need either of Entertainment, or a Cloak, who said:
<q>Give <hi>Hipponax</hi> a Cloak: I'm stiff with Cold.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But will you speak a Paradox indeed, both extravagant, and singular? Say, that a wise Man has need of Nothing, that he wants Nothing. He is fortunate, he is free from Want, he is self-sufficient, blessed, perfect. Now what Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:46327:227"/> is this that he, to whom nothing is wanting, has need of the Goods, he has; but that the Vitious indeed wants many things, but stands in need of Nothing. For thus indeed says <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> that the Vicious wants, but stands not in need: removing the common Notions, like Chess-men, backwards and forwards. For all Men think, that having Need precedes Wanting, esteeming him, who stands in need of things, that are not at hand, or easie to be got, to want them. For no Man wants Horns or Wings, because he has no need of them. But we say, that those want Arms, and Money, and Cloaths, who are destitute of them, when they have occasion for them. But these Men are so desirous of seeming always to say something against the common Notions, that for the Love of Novelty they often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their own Opinions, as they do here: [which that you may the better perceive] recall your self to the Consideration of what has been said a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                  <p>This is one of their Assertions against the common Conceptions, that no vitious Man receives any Utility: And yet many, being instructed, profit; many, being Slaves, are made free; many, being Besieg'd, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd; being Lame, are led by the Hand; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sick, are cur'd: But possessing all these things, they are never the better, neither do receive Benefits, nor have they any Benefactors, nor do they slight them. Vitious Men then are not ungrateful, no more than are wise Men. Ingratitude therefore has no Being: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Good, receiving a Benefit, fail not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and the Bad are not capable of receiving any. Behold now, what they say to this: [to wit] that Benefit is rank'd amongst [mean, or] middle things, and that to give and receive Utility, belongs only to the Wise; but the Bad also receive a Benefit. Then they who partake of a Benefit, partake not also of its Use:
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:46327:227"/> and whither a Benefit extends, there is nothing useful or commodious. Now what else is there, that maks a kind Office a Benefit, but that the Bestower of it is in some respect useful to the needy Receiver?</p>

                  <speaker>Lamprias.</speaker>
                  <p>But let these things pass. What [I beseech you] is this so highly venerated Utility, which preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as some great and excellent thing, for the Wise, they permit not so much as the Name of it to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Diadumenus.</speaker>
                  <p>If, [say they] one wise Man does but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way prudently stretch out his Finger, all the wise Men all the World over receive Utility by it. This is the Work of their Amity, in this do the Vertues of the wise Men terminate by their common Utilities. <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> then and <hi>Xenocrates</hi> doated, saying, that Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Utility from the Gods, from their Parents, from their Masters, being ignorant of that wonderful Utility, which wise Men receive from one another, being mov'd according to Vertue, though they neither are together, nor yet know it. Yet all Men esteem, that laying up, keeping, and bestowing are then useful and profitable, when some Benefit or Profit is recover'd by it. The thriving Man buys Keys, and diligently keeps his Stores,
<q>With's Hand unlocking Wealths sweet Treasury.</q>

                  <p>But to store up, and to keep with diligence and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour such things, as are for no use, is not seemly or honorable, but ridiculous. If <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> indeed had ty'd up with the Knot, which <hi>Circe</hi> taught him, not the Gifts, he had receiv'd from <hi>Alcinous,</hi> Tripodes, Caldrons, Cloths, and Gold; but heaping up Trash, Stones, and such like Trumpery, should have thought his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about such things, and the Possession, and Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, an happy and blessed Work: would any
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:46327:228"/> one have imitated this foolish Providence, and empty Care? Yet this is the Beauty, Gravity, and Happiness of the <hi>Stoical</hi> Consent, being nothing else but a gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, and keeping of useless and indifferent things. For such are things according to Nature, and more, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior things: If they compare the greatest Riches to Fringes and golden Chamber-pots, and sometimes also, as it happens to Oil Cruets. Then, as those, who seem proudly to have affronted and rail'd at some Gods or Demi-Gods, presently changing their Note, fall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and sit humbly on the Ground, praising and magnifying the Divinity: so these Men, through a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Punishment of this Arrogancy and Vanity, again exercise themselves in these indifferent things, and such as pertain nothing to them, crying out with a loud Voice, how good, how specious, and how honorable a thing, the storing up of these things, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in them is, and that 'tis not meet for those, who have them not, to live, but to dispatch out of the way, and famish themselves, bidding a long Farewel to Vertue.</p>
                  <p>They esteem indeed <hi>Theognis</hi> to have been a Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of a base and abject Spirit, for saying, as one over-fearful, [in Verse:]
<q>
                        <l>From Poverty to fly, into the Deep</l>
                        <l>Throw thy self, <hi>Cyrnus,</hi> or from Rocks so steep.</l>
                     </q> Yet they themselves exhort the same thing, and affirm, that a Man, to free himself from some great Disease, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly acute Pain, if he have not at hand Sword or Poyson, ought to leap into the Sea, or throw himself headlong from a Precipice. Neither of which is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or evil, or incommodious, or makes them, who fall into it, miserable. <hi>With what then,</hi> says he, <hi>shall I begin? and what shall I take for the Principle of Duty, and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:46327:228"/> Matter of Vertue, leaving Nature, and that, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature?</hi> With what, O good Sir, do <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>stotle</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> begin? What Beginnings do <hi>Xenocrates</hi> and <hi>Polemon</hi> take? Does not also <hi>Zeno</hi> follow these, supposing Nature, and that, which is according to Nature, to be the Elements of Happiness? But they indeed persisted in these things, as desirable, good, and profitable, and joyning to them Vertue, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys them, and uses every one of them according to its Property, thought to compleat and consummate a perfect Life, and one every way absolute, producing that Concord, which is truly suitable and consonant to Nature: Not like those, who, leaping up from the Ground, and presently falling down again upon it, were disturb'd, terming the same things acceptable, and not desirable; proper, and not good; unprofitable, and yet useful; nothing to us, and yet the Principles of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But the Life of those Men was such, as their Speech exhibiting their Actions suitable and consonant to their Sayings. But they, who are of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> Sect, not unlike to that Woman in <hi>Archilochus,</hi> who deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully carry'd in one Hand Water, in the other Fire, by some Doctrines draw Nature to them, and by others drive her from them. Or rather by their Deeds and Actions they embrace those things, which are according to Nature, as good and desirable; but in Words and Speeches they reject and contemn them, as indifferent and of no use to Vertue, for the acquiring Felicity.</p>
                  <p>Now, forasmuch as all Men esteem the Soveraign Good to be joyous, desirable, happy, of the greatest Dignity, self-sufficient, and wanting nothing: compare their Good, and see, [how it ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ees with this common Conception.] Does the stretching out a Finger pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently produce this Joy? Is a prudent Torture a thing desirable? Is he happy, who with reason breaks his Neck? Is that of the greatest Dignity, which Reason
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:46327:229"/> often chooses to let go for that, which is not Good? Is that perfect, and self sufficient, which though they enjoy, yet if they have not also indifferent things, they neither can nor will endure to live? Was there ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Discourse, by which Custom was more injur'd, taking and plucking from her her genuine Notions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as her Legitimate Children, and supposing other bastardly, wild, and illegitimate ones in their room, and necessitating her to nourish and cherish the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the other? and that in those which concern things good and bad, desirable and avoidable, proper and strange, the Energy of which ought to be more clearly distinguished, than that of Hot and Cold, Black and White. For the Imaginations of these things are brought in by the Senses from without; but those have their Original bred from the good things, which we have within us. But these Men entring with their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick upon the Topick of Felicity, as on the Sophism, call'd <hi>Pseudomenos,</hi> or that nam'd <hi>Kyrieuon,</hi> have remov'd no Ambiguity, but brought in very many.</p>
                  <p>Indeed of two good things, of which the one is the End, the other belongs to the End, none is ignorant, that the End is the greater and perfecter Good. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siptus</hi> also acknowledges this Difference, as is manifest from his third Book, <hi>of good Things.</hi> For he dissents from those, who make Science the End, and sets it down in his Treatise <hi>of Justice.</hi> And if any one sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses Pleasure to be the End, he does not think, that Justice can be safe; but grants, it may, if Pleasure is not said to be the End, but simply a Good. Nor do I think, that you would now hear me repeating his Words: since his third Book of <hi>Justice</hi> is every where to be had. When therefore, O my Friend, they elsewhere say, that no one Good is greater or less than another, and that what is not the End, is equal to the End, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict not only the common Conceptions, but even their
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:46327:229"/> own Words. Again, if of two Evils, the one, when it is present, renders us worse, and the other hurts us indeed, but renders us not worse, that in my Opinion is the greater, which renders us worse. Now <hi>Chrysippus</hi> indeed confesses, that there are some Fears, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and Errors, which hurt us, but render us not worse. Read his first Book <hi>of Justice</hi> against <hi>Plato:</hi> for in respect of other things, 'tis worth the while to note the Babling of the Man in that Place, delivering indifferently all Matters and Doctrines, as well proper to his own Sect, as forreign, against common Sense: as when he says, that there may be two Ends or Scopes propos'd of Life, and that all the things we do, are not to be referr'd to one. And yet this is more against common Sense, that there is an End, and yet that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Action is to be referr'd to another, and nevertheless they must of necessity endure one of these. For if those things, that are first according to Nature, are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible for themselves and the last End, but the Choice and taking of them is agreeable to Reason, and that every one therefore does all his Actions for the acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first things according to Nature, and that all things which are done, have their Reference to this, that the principal things, according to Nature may be obtain'd. For if they think, that they who neither aim nor aspire to get these things, have an end, there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, to which the Choice of these things must be referr'd, and not the things themselves. For the end indeed is to choose and receive these things prudently But the things themselves, and the enjoying of them, is not the End, but is subjected as a certain Matter, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Worthiness to be chosen. For this is my Opinion, that they both use and write this very Expression, to shew the Difference.</p>

                  <p>But observe, how it fares with them, as with those, that endeavor to leap over their own Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: for they do not leave behind, but [always] carry along with them in their Speech some Absurdity, most remote from common Sense. For as, if any one should say, that he, who shoots, does all he can, not that he may hit the Mark, but that he may do, all he can, such an one would rightly be esteem'd to speak enigmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and prodigiously: so these doating Dreamers, who contend, that the obtaining of natural things is not the End of aiming after natural things, but only the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and choosing them; and that the Desire and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor after Health is not in every one terminated in the Enjoyment of Health; but that on the contrary, the Enjoyment of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alth is referr'd to the Desire and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor after it, and that certain Walkings, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Speech, and suffering Incisions, and taking of Medicines, so they are done by Reason, are the End of Health, and not Health of them: [they, <hi>I say</hi>] trifle like to those, who say, <hi>Let us Sup, that we may Kill, that we may Bath.</hi> But this rather changes Order and Custom, and all things, which these Men say, carry with them the total Subversion and Confusion of Affairs. Thus we do not desire to take a Walk in fit time, that we may digest our Meat; but [we digest our Meat] that we may take a Walk in fit time. Has Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so made Health for the Sake of Hellebore, instead of producing Hellebore for the Sake of Health? For what is wanting to bring them to the highest Degree of speaking Paradoxes, but the saying of such things? What difference is there between him, who says that Health was made for the Sake of Medicines, and not Medicines for the Sake of Health; and him, who makes the Choice of Medicines, and their Composition, and Use, more desirable than Health it self? or rather, who esteems Health not at all desirable, but placing the End
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:46327:230"/> in the Negotiation about these things, prefers Desire to Enjoyment, and not Enjoyment to Desire: For to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; forsooth, is joyn'd the Proceeding wisely and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly. 'Tis true indeed, we will say, if Respect be had to the End, [that is] the Enjoyment and Possession of the Things, it pursues; but otherwise 'tis wholly void of Reason, if it does all things for the obtaining of that, the Enjoyment of which is neither Honorable nor Happy.</p>

                  <p>Now since we are fallen upon this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, any thing may rather be said to agree with common Sense, than that those, who have neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd nor have any Conception of Good, do never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless desire and pursue it: For you see, how <hi>Chrysip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> drives <hi>Ariston</hi> into this Difficulty, that he should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand an Indifference in things, enclining neither to Good nor Bad, before either Good or Bad are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves understood: for so its Indifference will appear to have subsisted before, if the understanding of it cannot be perceiv'd, unless Good be understood: now this is no other thing, but only Good.</p>

                  <p>Understand now, and consider this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference taken out of the <hi>Stoa,</hi> and call'd Consent: whence, and in what manner it gives us the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good, for if without Good the Indifference to that, which is not Good, cannot be understood: much less does the Prudence of good things give any Intelligence to those, who had not before some Prenotion of the Good. But as there can be no Knowledge of the Art of things wholsome and unwholsome in those, who have not first some Knowledge of the things themselves: so they cannot conceive any Notion of the Science of Good and Evil, who have not some Fore-knowledge of Good and Evil. What then is Good? Nothing, but Prudence. And what is Prudence? Nothing, but the Science of Good. There is much then of <hi>Jupiters Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
                     <pb n="442" facs="tcp:46327:231"/>
[that is, much Begging of the Question] admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their Reasoning. For I would have you let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the Turning of the Pestle, lest you should seem to mock them: Although an Accident, like to that, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated it self into their Discourse. For it seems, that to the Understanding of Good one has need to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Prudence, and to seek for Prudence in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Good, being forc'd always to pursue the one by the other, and thus failing of both: since to the Understanding of each, we have need of that, which cannot be known, without the other be first under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. But there is yet another way, by which you may perceive not only the Perversion, but the Eversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Discourse, and the reduction of it entirely to nothing.</p>
                  <p>They hold the Essence of Good to be the reasonable Election of things according to Nature: Now the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is not reasonable, which is directed to some End, as has been said before. What then is this? Nothing else, say they, but to reason rightly in the Election of things according to Nature. First then, the Conception of Good is lost and gone: For to reason rightly in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is an Operation, proceeding from an Habit of right Reasoning: and therefore being constrain'd to take this from the End, and the End not without this, we fail of understanding either of them. Besides, which is more, this reasonable Election must be a Choice of thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> good, and reasonable, and cooperating to the End: for how can it be reasonable to choose things, which are neither convenient, nor honorable, nor at all eligible? For be it, as they say, a reasonable Election of things, having a Fitness for the causing Felicity: see then to what a beautiful and venerable Conclusion their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course brings them. For the End is (it seems) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, to reason rightly in the Choice of things, which have a Fitness for the procuring of Happiness.

                  <p>Now then, having discover'd the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, see, what befalls them. They say, that the End is to reason rightly, and that Men neither have nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any thing of Felicity, but this precious Rectitude of Reasoning in the Elections of things, that are of worth. But there are some, who think, that this is spoken against <hi>Antipater,</hi> and not against the whole Sect: for that he, being press'd by <hi>Carneades,</hi> fell into these Fooleries.</p>
                  <p>But as for those things, that are against the common Conceptions taught in the <hi>Stoa</hi> concerning Love, they are all of them concern'd in the Absurdity. They say, that those Youths are deform'd, who are vitious and foolish; and that the Wise are fair: and yet that none of these beautiful ones is either belov'd, or worthy of being belov'd. Nor yet is this the worst; but they add, that those deform'd ones, who are belov'd, cease to be so,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:46327:232"/> when they are become fair. Now, whoever knew such a Love, which is kindled, and has its Being at the Sight of the Bodies Deformity, joyn'd with that of the Soul; and is quench'd and decays at the Accession of Beauty, joyn'd with Prudence, Justice and Temperance? These Men are not unlike to those Gnats, which love to settle on the Dregs of Wine, or on Vinegar, but shun and fly away from potable and pleasant Wine. As for that, which they call and term an Apparence of Beauty, saying, that it is the Inducement of Love: first it has no Probability: for in those, who are very foul, and highly wicked, there cannot be an Appearance of Beauty, if indeed the Wickedness of the Disposition fills the Face with Deformity. And what is this at last, which some of them say, that the Deformed is worthy of Love, because he one Day will be fair, and expects to have Beauty; but that, when he has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it, and is become fair and good, he is belov'd of none? For Love, they say, is a certain Hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a young Person, as yet indeed unperfect, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well-dispos'd towards Vertue.</p>

                  <p>And what do we now else, O my best Friend, but demonstrate, that their Sect perverts and destroys all our common Conceptions with improbable things, and unusual Expressions? For none would hinder the Sollicitude of these wise Men towards young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, if it were free from that passionate Affection, which all think and say [to be such, as <hi>Penelope</hi>'s Suitors in <hi>Homer</hi> seem to acknowledge,]

                  <p>Thus casting moral Philosophy into these Perplexities, in which there is nothing sound, they contemn and deride all about them, as if they were the only Men, who, regulating Nature and Custom, as it ought to be, do accordingly frame their Speech. And yet Nature by its Desires, Pursuits, and Impulses, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts and induces every one to what is fit. But the Custom of Logick being rendred contentious, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd no Benefit or Good, but, like the Ear, diseas'd by vain Sounds, is fill'd with Difficulty and Obscurity. Of which, if you think good, we will elsewhere begin a new Discourse. But now we will run through the chief and principal Heads of their Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, which no less confounds the common Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than that other concerning Ends. First, this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together absurd, and against Sense, [to say] that is, which is not, and that things, which are not, are. But above all, that is most absurd, which they say of the Universe. For putting round about the Circumference of the World an infinite <hi>Vacuum,</hi> they say, that the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse neither is a Body, nor bodiless. It follows then from this, that the Universe has no Being: since with them, Body only has a Being. Since therefore 'tis the Part of that, which has a Being, both to do and suffer, and the Universe has no being: it follows, that the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse will neither do nor suffer, neither will it be in a Place. For that which takes up Place, is a Body, and the Universe is not a Body. And since that only rests, which continues in one and the same Place, the Universe rests not, because it takes not up Place. Neither yet is it mov'd, for what is mov'd must have a Place and Space subjected. Moreover, what is mov'd, either moves it self, or suffers Motion from another. Now that, which is mov'd by it self, has some Bents and Inclinations, proceeding from its Gravity or Levity: Now Gravity and Levity are certain Habits, or Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:46327:233"/> or Differences of every Body. But the Universe is not a Body: It follows then of Necessity, that the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse is neither heavy nor light, and consequently that it has not in it self any Principle of Motion. Nor yet will the Universe be mov'd by any other: for there is nothing else, besides the Universe. Thus are they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to say, as they do, that the Universe neither rests, nor is mov'd. Lastly, since, according to their Opinion, it must not be said, that the Universe is a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and yet the Heaven, the Earth, Animals, Plants, Men, and Stones, are Bodies: that, which is no Body, will have Bodies for its Parts, and things, which have Existence, will be parts of that, which has no Existence: and that, which is not heavy, will have parts, that are heavy, and what is not light, Parts, that are light: than which there cannot be any Dreams imagin'd more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the common Conceptions. Moreover, there is nothing so evident, or so agreeing to common Sense, as that what is not animate, is animate; and what is not inanimate, is inanimate. And yet they overthrow also this Evidence, confessing the Universe to be neither animate nor inanimate. Besides this, none thinks the Universe, of which there is no part wanting, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: But they deny the Universe to be perfect: saying, that what is perfect, may be defin'd; but the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, because of its Infiniteness, cannot be defin'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to them, there is something, which is neither perfect, nor unperfect. Moreover, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse is neither a Part, since there is nothing greater than it; nor the Whole, for the Whole, they say, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated only of that, which is digested into Order: but the Universe is through its Infiniteness undetermin'd, and unorder'd. Moreover, there is not any Cause of the Universe, there being nothing besides the Universe: nor is the Universe the Cause either of other things, or of it self: for its Nature suffers it not to act: and a Cause is
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:46327:233"/> understood by Acting. Suppose now, one should ask all Men, what they imagine <hi>Nothing</hi> to be, and what Notion they have of it; would they not answer, that it is neither a Cause, nor has a Cause, that 'tis neither the Whole, nor a Part, that 'tis neither perfect, nor unperfect, that 'tis neither animate nor inanimate, that that it is neither mov'd, nor rests, nor subsists, that 'tis neither corporeal, nor incorporeal; and that this, and no other thing, is meant by <hi>Nothing?</hi> Since then they alone predicate that of the <hi>Ʋniverse,</hi> which all others do of <hi>Nothing,</hi> it seems plain, that they make the <hi>Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi> and <hi>Nothing</hi> to be the same. Time must then be said to be <hi>Nothing,</hi> [the same also must be said of] Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, Axiom, Connex, Complex: which [Terms though] they use more than any of the other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, [yet] they say, that they are <hi>Non entia,</hi> [or things, that have no Being.] But farther to say, that what is true, has no Being, or Subsistence, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; and that that is comprehensible and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which no way partakes of the Essence of Being; does not this exceed all Absurdity?</p>
                  <p>But least these things should seem to have too much of Logical Difficulty, let us proceed to such as pertain more to Natural Philosophy. Since then, as themselves say,
<q>
                        <hi>Jove</hi> is of all Beginning, Midst and End:</q> They ought chiefly to have apply'd themselves to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, redress, and reduce to the best [Order] the Conceptions concerning the Gods, if there were in them any thing confus'd or erroneous; or if not, to have left every one in those Sentiments, which they had from the Laws and Custom concerning the Divinity:
<q>
                        <pb n="448" facs="tcp:46327:234"/>
                        <l>Since neither now nor yesterday began</l>
                        <l>These Thoughts; but have been ever; nor yet can</l>
                        <l>A Man be found, who their first Entrance knows.</l>
                     </q> But these Men, having begun as it were from <hi>Vesta</hi> to disturb the Opinions setled, and receiv'd in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try concerning the Gods, have not (to speak sincerely) left any thing entire and uncorrupted. For what Man is there, or ever was, except these, who does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Divinity to be immortal, and eternal? Or what is in the common Anticipations more unanimously chanted forth concerning the Gods, than such things, as these:
<q>
                        <l>There the blest Gods eternally enjoy</l>
                        <l>Their sweet Delights—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again,
<q>Both Gods immortal, and Earth-dwelling Men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again,
<q>
                        <l>Exempt from Sickness, and Old Age, are they</l>
                        <l>And free from Toil, and have escap'd the Bay</l>
                        <l>Of roaring <hi>Acheron—</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q> One may perhaps light upon some Nations so barbarous and savage, as not to think, there is a God; but there was never found any Man, who, believing a God, did not at the same time believe him immortal, and eternal. Certainly, those who were call'd Atheists, the <hi>Theodores, Diagorases,</hi> and <hi>Hippons,</hi> durst not say, that the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is corruptible; but they did not believe, that there is
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:46327:234"/> any thing incorruptible: not indeed admitting the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of an Incorruptibility, but keeping the Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of a God. But <hi>Chrysippus</hi> and <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> having fill'd, as one may say, Heaven, Earth, Air, and Sea, with Gods, have not yet made any one of all these Gods immortal, or eternal, except <hi>Jupiter</hi> alone, in whom they consume all the rest: so that in him to consume, is nothing better than to be consum'd. For 'tis an Infirmity both to perish by being resolv'd into another, and to be sav'd by being nourish'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of others into himself. Now these are not like other of their Absurdities, gather'd by Argument from their Suppositions, or drawn by Consequence from their Doctrines; but they themselves, proclaiming it aloud in their Writings concerning the Gods, providence, Fate and Nature, expresly say, that all the Gods were born, and shall dye by the Fire, melting away, in their Opinion, as if they were of Wax or Tin. 'Tis indeed as much against common Sense, that God should be mortal, as that Man should be immortal: nay, indeed I do not see, what the Difference between God and Man will be, if God also is a reasonable and corruptible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal. For if they oppose this fine and subtle Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, that Man is mortal, and God not mortal, but corruptible, see, what they get by it. For they will either say, that God is at the same time both immortal and corruptible, or else that he is neither mortal nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal: the Absurdity of which even those cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, who set themselves industriously to devise Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, repugnant to common Sense. I speak of others: for these Men have left no one of the absurdest things unspoken or unattempted.</p>
                  <p>To these things <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> contending for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of the World, says, that the Sun will make the Moon, and all the other Stars, like to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and will change them into himself. Indeed if the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:46327:235"/> Stars, being Gods, should contribute any thing to the Sun towards their own Destruction, 'twould be very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous for us to make Prayers to them for our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to think them the Saviours of Men, whose Nature it is to accelerate their own Corruption and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. And yet these Men leave nothing unsaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Epicurus,</hi> crying, <hi>Out, out, Fy, fy upon him,</hi> as confounding their Presumption concerning God, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away Providence; for God is not only presum'd and understood to be immortal and happy, but also a Lover of Men, and careful of them, and beneficial to them: and herein they say true. Now if they, who abolish Providence, take away the Pre-conception concerning God: what do they, who say, that the Gods indeed have care of us, but deny them to be helpful to us, and make them not Bestowers of good things, but of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ones; giving to wit, not Vertue, but Wealth, Health, Children, and such like things, none of which is helpful, profitable, desirable or available? Or do not those indeed take away the Conceptions concerning the Gods, but these also scoff at them, and deride them, saying, that one God is a Fruiterer, another a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Broker, another a Physician, and another a Divine? And yet neither Health, nor Issue, nor plenty of Fruits, are good, but unprofitable to those, who have them.</p>
                  <p>The third Point of the Conception concerning the Gods is, that the Gods do in nothing so much differ from Men, as in Happiness and Vertue. But, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> they have not so much as this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: for [he says] that <hi>Jupiter</hi> does not exceed <hi>Dion</hi> in Vertue, but that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Dion,</hi> being both wise, are equally aided by one another, when the one enjoys the Motion of the other. For this, and none else, is the Good, which the Gods do to Men, and Men like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the Gods, when they are Wise. For they say,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:46327:235"/> that a Man, who falls not short in Vertue, comes not behind them also in Felicity: and that he, who, being tormented with Diseases and violent Pains of the Body, makes himself away, is equally happy with <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Savior, provided he be but Wise. But this Man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor ever was upon the Earth; but there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite millions of Men, unhappy to the highest degree, in the State and Government of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which is most excellently administred. Now, what can be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sense, than that, <hi>Jupiter</hi> governing exceedingly well, we should be exceedingly miserable? But if, which 'tis unlawful even to say, he would no longer be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, nor a Deliverer, nor a Protector, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all these glorious Appellations, there can no Goodness be added to the things, that are, neither as to their Multitude, nor Magnitude, as these Men say, all Men living to the height miserably and wickedly, and Vice neither receiving Addition, nor Unhappiness In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this the worst; but they are angry with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander</hi> for saying upon the Stage;
<q>
                        <l>The chief Beginning of Mens Miseries</l>
                        <l>Are things exceeding good.—</l>
                     </q> For that this is against Sense. And yet they make God, who is good, the Beginning of Evils. For Matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd not any Evil of it self: for it is without Quality, and whatever Differences it has, it has receiv'd them all from that, which moves, and forms it: if indeed Reason, which is within, does also form it, not being made to move and form it self. So that of necessity, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, if [it come] by. Nothing, must have been produc'd from that, which has no Being; but if by some mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principle, from God. But if they think, that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> has not the Command of his Parts, nor uses every
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:46327:236"/> one of them according to his Reason, they speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst common Sense, and imagine an Animal, many of whose Parts are not subservient to his Will, using their own Operations and Actions, to which the whole gives no Incitation, nor begins their Motion. For there is nothing, which has Life, so ill compacted, as that against its Will, its Feet should go, its Tongue speak, its Hours push, or its Teeth bite. The most of which things God must of necessity suffer, if the Wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parts of him, do against his Will ly, cheat, rob, and murther one another. But if, as <hi>Chysippus</hi> says, the very least part cannot possibly behave it self otherwise, than according to <hi>Jupiters</hi> Pleasure, and if every living thing is so fram'd by Nature, as to rest, and move ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he inclines it, and as he turns, stays, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses it:
<q>This Saying is more impious than the former.</q> For 'twere more tolerable to say, that many Parts of <hi>Jupiter</hi> are through his Weakness and Want of Power, hurry'd on to do many absurd things against his Nature and Will, than that there is not any Intemperance or Wickedness, of which <hi>Jupiter</hi> is not the Cause.</p>
                  <p>Moreover [since they affirm] the World to be a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Stars Citizens, if this [be so, there must be also] Tribes and Magistrates, the Sun [must be some] Consul, and the Evening Star a Praetor or Mayor of a City. Now I know not, whether any one, that shall go about to confute them for asserting and affirming such things, can shew any greater Absurdities than those things, which, they say, are most natural.</p>
                  <p>Is it not therefore against Sense [to say,] that the Seed is more and greater than that, which is produc'd of it? For we see, that Nature in all Animals and Plants, even those, that are wild, has taken small, slender, and scarce
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:46327:236"/> visible things for Principles of Generation to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. For it does not only from a Grain of Wheat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Ear-bearing Stalk, or a Vine from the Stone of a Grape, but from a small Berry, or Acorn, which has escap'd being eaten by the Bird, kindling and setting a fire Generation, as it were from a little Spark, it sends forth the Stock of a Bush, or the tall Body of an Oak, Palm, or Pine-Tree. Whence also they say, that Seed is in <hi>Greek</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or the wrapping up of a great Mass in a little Compass, and that Nature has the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as if it were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Inflation and Diffusion of Reasons and Numbers, open'd and loosen'd by it. And again, the Fire of the World, which, they say, is its Seed, shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conflagration change into its own Seed the World, having a copious Nature from a smaller Body and Bulk, and possessing an infinite space of <hi>Vacuum,</hi> fill'd by its Increase, and the World being made, the Weakness again recedes and settles, the Matter being after the Generation gather'd and contracted into it self. You may hear them, and read many of their Writings, in which they jangle with the <hi>Academicks,</hi> and cry out against them, as confounding all things with their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallaxes,</hi> [that is,] in distinguishable Identities, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently contending, that there is but one qualify'd in two Substances. And yet there is no Man, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands not this, and would not on the contrary think it wonderful and extreamly strange, if there should not at all times be found a Stock-Dove to a Stock-Dove, a Bee to a Bee, a Grain of Wheat to a Grain of Wheat, nor, as the Proverb has it, one Fig to another, exactly, and in all respects, alike.</p>
                  <p>But these things are plainly against common Sence, which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> say, and feign, that there are in one Substance two particularly qualify'd, and that the same Substance, which has particularly one qualify'd, receives
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:46327:237"/> and equally conserves them both. For if there may be two, there may be also three, four and five, and even as many, as you can name, in one and the same Substance, I say not, in its different Parts, but all equally, though even infinite in the whole. <hi>Chrysippus</hi> then says, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> is like to Man, as is also the World, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to the Soul. When therefore the Conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be, <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who alone of all the Gods is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, will retire into Providence, and they being together, will both perpetually remain in one Substance of the Aether.</p>
                  <p>But leaving now the Gods, and beseeching them to give [these <hi>Stoicks</hi>] common Sense, and a common Understanding, let us look into their Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the-Elements. 'Tis against the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, that one Body should be the Place of another, or that a Body should penetrate through a Body, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them containing any Vacuity; but the Full pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing into the Full, and that, which has no distance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full, and not having any Place by reason of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity, receiving the Mixture. But these Men, not thrusting one thing into one, nor yet two, or three, or ten together; but jumbling all the Parts of the World, being cut piece-meal, in any one thing, which they shall first light on, and saying, that the very least, which is perceiv'd by Sense, will contain the greatest, that shall come unto it, boldly frame a new Doctrine, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, of that, which convinces them, taking for their Suppositions things repugnant to common Sense. And presently upon this [they are forc'd] to admit into their Discourse many monstrous and strange Positions, mixing whole Bodies with whole; of which this also is one, that three are four: for this others put as an Example of those things, which cannot be conceiv'd even in thought. But to the <hi>Stoicks</hi> it is a Matter of Truth, that one Cup of Wine, being mixt with two
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:46327:237"/> of Water, it will not fail but equal them, extending the whole, and confounding it, to make that, which is one, two, by the Equality of the Mixture with two: For that one remains, and is extended as much as two, and makes that, which is equal to the Double. Now if it happens in the Mixture with two to take the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of two in the Diffusion, this is together the Measure both of three and four; of three, because one is mixt with two; and of four, because being mixt with two, it has an equal Quantity with those, with which it is mixt. Now this fine Subtilty is a Consequence of their putting Bodies into a Body, and the untelligibleness of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how one is contain'd in the Other. For 'tis of necessity, that of Bodies, passing one into another by Mixture, the one should not contain, and the other be contain'd, nor the one receive, and the other be receiv'd within; for this would not be a Mixture, but a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity and Touching of the Superficies, the one entring in, and the other enclosing it without, and the rest of the Parts remaining unmixt and pure, and so it would be one of many different things. But there being a Necessity, according to their Axiom of Mixture, that the things, which are mixt, should be mingled one within the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that the same thing should together be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by being within, and by receiving, contain the other, and that neither of them can possibly be again, [what it was before,] it comes to pass, that both the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Mixture mutually penetrate each other, and that there is not any part of either remaining separate; but that they are necessarily all fill'd with each other. Here now that Leg of <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> comes in, with much Laughter insulting over their Absurdities; for if these Mixtions are through the whole, what should hinder, but that, this Leg being cut off, and putrify'd, and cast into the Sea, and diffus'd, not only <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Fleet, as <hi>Arc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>silaus</hi> said, might sail through it, but also <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:46327:238"/> twelve hundred Ships, together with the <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cians</hi> three hundred Gallies, might fight in it? For the Progress will not thenceforth fail, nor the lesser cease to be in the greater, or else the Mixture will be at an end, and the Extremity of it, touching, where it shall end, will not pass through the whole, but will give over being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. But if the Mixture is through the whole, will not the Leg indeed afford the <hi>Greeks</hi> room for a Sea-fight; but to this there is need of Putrefaction and Change? But if one Glass, or but one Drop of Wine shall fall from hence into the <hi>Aegean</hi> or <hi>Cretian</hi> Sea, it will pass into the <hi>Ocean</hi> or main <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching its Superficies, but being spread quite through it in Depth, Breadth and Length. And this <hi>Chrysippus</hi> admits, saying immediately in his first Book of Natural Questions, that there is nothing to hinder one Drop of Wine from being mixt with the whole Sea. And that we may not wonder at this, he says, that this one Drop will by Mixtion extend through the whole World. Than which, I know not any thing, that can appear more absurd.</p>
                  <p>And this also is against Sense, that there is not in the Nature of Bodies any thing either Supream, or first, or last, in which the Magnitude of the Body may termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; but that the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of it, still going on, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Subject to Infinity and Undeterminateness. For one Body cannot be imagin'd greater or less than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if both of them may by their Parts proceed <hi>in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum;</hi> but the Nature of Inequality is taken away: For of things, that are esteem'd unequal, the one falls short in its last Parts, and the other goes on, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. Now if there is no Inequality, it follows, that there is no Unevenness, nor Roughness of Bodies: for Unevenness is the Inequality of the same Superficies with it self, and Roughness is an Unevenness, joyn'd with Hardness: neither of which is left us by those, who
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:46327:238"/> terminate no Body in its last part, but extend them all by the Multitude of their Parts unto an Infinity. And yet is it not evident, that a Man consists of more Parts, than a Finger, and the World of more than a Man? This indeed all Men know and understand, unless they become <hi>Stoicks;</hi> but if they are once <hi>Stoicks,</hi> they on the contrary say and think, that a Man has no more Parts than a Finger, nor the World than a Man. For Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion reduces Bodies to an Infinity; and of Infinites neither is more, or less, or exceeds in Multitude, nor will the Parts of the Remainder cease to be divided, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a Multitude of themselves. How then do they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themselves out of these Difficulties? Surely with very great Cunning and Courage. For <hi>Chrysippus</hi> says, that being askt, if we have any Parts, and how many, and of what, and how many other Parts, they consist, we are to use a Distinction, making it a Position, that the whole Body is compacted of the Head, Trunk, and Legs, as if that were all, which is enquir'd and doubted of. But if they extend their Interrogation to the last Parts, no such thing is to be undertaken, but we are to say, that they consist not of any certain Parts, nor yet of so many, nor of infinite, nor of finite. And I seem to my self to have us'd his very Words, that you may perceive, how he maintains the common Notions, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding us to think, of what, or how many Parts every Body is compacted, and whether of infinite or finite. For if there were any <hi>Medium</hi> between Finite and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, as <hi>Indifferent</hi> is between Good and Evil, he should by telling us, what that is, have solv'd the Difficulty. But if, as that, which is not equal, is presently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be unequal, and that, which is not mortal, to be immortal, we also understand, that, which is not finite, to be immediately infinite: to say, that a Body consists of Parts, neither finite, nor infinite, is, in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, the same thing, as to affirm, that an Argument
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:46327:239"/> is compacted of Positions, neither true, nor false, [and Number neither of Even, nor Odd.] To this, he with a certain youthful Rashness adds, that, a Pyramis consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Triangles, the Sides, inclining according to the Juncture, are unequal, and yet do not extend one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that they are greater.</p>
                  <p>Thus does he keep the common Notions. For if there is any thing greater, and not exceeding, there will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so something less, and not deficient; and so also some thing unequal, which neither exceeds, nor is deficient: that is, there will be an equal thing unequal, a greater not greater, and a less not less. See yet farther, in what manner he answer'd <hi>Democritus,</hi> enquiring philosophical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earnestly, if a Cone is divided by a Level at the Basis, what is to be thought of the Superficies of its Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whether they are equal or unequal: for if they are unequal, they will render the Cone uneven, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Step-like Incisions and Roughnesses; but if they are equal, the Sections also will be equal, and the Cone will seem to be affected in the same manner, as the Cylinder, to wit, to be compos'd not of unequal, but of equal Circles; which is most absurd. Here, that he may convince <hi>Democritus</hi> of Ignorance, he says, that the Superficies are neither equal or unequal; but that the Bodies are unequal, because the Superficies are neither equal nor unequal. Indeed to ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rt this for a Law, that Bodies happen to be unequal, the Superficies not being unequal, is the part of a Man, who takes to himself a wonderful Liberty of Writing, whatever comes into his Head. For Reason and manifest Evidence on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary give us to understand, that the Superficies of une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Bodies are unequal, and that the bigger the Body is, the greater also is the Superficies, unless the Excess, by which it is the greater, is void of a Superficies. For if the Superficies of the greater Bodies do not exceed those of the less, but sooner fail, the Part of that Body, which
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:46327:239"/> has an End, will be without an End, and infinite. For if he says, that he is compell'd to this [lest the Inequality of the Superficies might make unequal Incisions, there is no Reason for it.] For those rabbotted Incisions, which he suspects in a Cone, are made by the Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Body, and not of the Superficies. 'Twere ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous therefore, that the taking away the Superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es should leave a manifest Unevenness in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>But to persist still in this Matter, what is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Sense, than the imagining of such things? For if we admit, that one Superficies is neither equal nor unequal to another, we may say also of Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and of Number, that one is neither equal nor unequal to another, and this, not having any thing, that we can call or think to be a Neuter, or <hi>Medium</hi> between Equal and Unequal. Besides, if there are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, neither equal nor unequal, what hinders, but there may be also Circles, neither equal nor unequal? For indeed these Superficies of Conick Sections are Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And if Circles, why may not also their Diameters be neither equal nor unequal? And if so, why not also Angles, Triangles, Parallelograms, Parallelepipeds, and Bodies? For if Longitudes are neither equal nor unequal to one another, neither will Weight, Percussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Bodies be equal or unequal. How then dare these Men inveigh against those, who introduce Vacuities, and suppose, that there are some <hi>Individuums,</hi> and things, combating each other, which neither move, nor are still? when themselves affirm such Axioms, as these, to be false: <hi>If any things are not equal to one another, they are unequal to one another:</hi> and <hi>these things are not equal to one another, therefore they are unequal to one another.</hi> But because he says, that there is something greater, and yet not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, it were worth the while to ask, whether these things quadrate with one another. For if they quadrate,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:46327:240"/> how is either the greater? and if they do not quadrate, how can it be, but the one must exceed, and the other fall short? For if neither of these be, it will not quadrate with the greater, or it will also quadrate, that the other is the greater. For those, who keep not the common Conceptions, must of necessity fall into such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities.</p>
                  <p>'Tis moreover against Sense to say, that nothing touches another; nor is this less, that Bodies touch one another, but touch by nothing. For they are necessitated to admit these things, who leave not the least Parts of a Body, but receive any thing, which is before that, which seems to touch, and never cease to pass still on farther. What therefore these Men principally object to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of [those] indivisible [Bodies, call'd Atoms] is this, that there is neither a touching of the whole, nor of the Parts by the Parts: for that this makes not a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a Mixture, and that this is not possible, these Individuals having no Parts. How then do not they themselves fall into the same Inconvenience, leaving no first or last Part, whilst they say, that whole Bodies mutually touch one another by a Term [or Extremity] and not by a Part? but this Term is not a Body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one Body shall touch another by that, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, and again shall not touch, that, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, coming between them. And if it shall touch, the Body shall both do, and suffer something by that, which is incorporeal. For 'tis the Nature of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies mutually to do and suffer, and to touch. But if the Body has a Touching by that, which is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, it will have also a Contact, and a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a Coalition. Again, in these Contacts and Mixtures, the Extremities of the Bodies must either remain, or not remain, but be corrupted. Now both of these are against Sense. For neither do they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves admit Corruptions and Generations of incorporeal
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:46327:240"/> things; nor can there be a Mixture and Coalition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, retaining their own Extremities. For the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity determines and constitutes the Nature of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and Mixtions, unless the mutual laying of Parts by Parts are thereby understood, wholly confound all those things that are mixt. And, as these Men say, we must admit the Corruptions of Extremities in Mixtures, and their Generation again in the Separations of them. But this none can easily understand; for by what Bodies mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually touch each other, by the same they press, thrust, and crush each other. Now to do or suffer this by things, that are incorporeal, is impossible, and not so much as to be imagin'd. But by this they [would] con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain us to understand it. For if a Sphere [or round Body] touch a Plain [or flat Body] by a Point, 'tis manifest, that it may be also roll'd upon the Plain by a Point, and if the Superficies of it is painted with Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, it will imprint a red Line on the Plain, and if it is fiery hot, it will burn [or scorch] the Plain. Now for an incorporeal thing to color, or a Body to be burnt by that, which is incorporeal, is against Sense. But if we should imagine an earthen or glassy Sphere to fall from an high on a Plain of Stone, 'twere against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to think, it would not be broken, being struck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that which is hard and solid; but 'twould be more absurd, that it should be broken, falling by an Extremity, or Point, that is incorporeal. So that the Anticipations concerning things Incorporeal and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real are wholly disturb'd, or rather taken away, by their joyning to them many Impossibilities.</p>
                  <p>'Tis also against common Sense, that there should be a Time future, and past, but no time present, and that <hi>Erewhile</hi> and <hi>Lately</hi> subsist, but <hi>Now</hi> is nothing at all. Yet this often befalls the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who admit not the least time [between] nor will allow the Present to be indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but whatsoever any one thinks to take and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:46327:241"/> as present, one part of that they say to be futur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and the other part past: so that there is no Part remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or left of the present Time; but of that, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> said to be present, one part is distributed to the future, the other to the past. Therefore one of these two things follows, either that holding there was a Time, and there will be a Time, we must deny, there is a Time; or must hold, that there is a Time present, part of which has already been, and part will be; and say, that of that, which now is, one part is future, and the other past; and that of <hi>Now,</hi> one part is before, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behind; and that of <hi>Now</hi> is that, which is neither yet <hi>Now,</hi> nor still <hi>Now:</hi> for that, which is past, is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Now,</hi> and that, which is to come, is not yet <hi>Now.</hi> And dividing [thus the present, they must needs] say of the [Year, and of the Light] that part of it was of the Year past, and part will be of the Year to come; and that of what is together, there is a first, and a last. For no less are they perplext, confounding together these Terms, <hi>Not yet,</hi> and <hi>Already,</hi> and <hi>No longer,</hi> and <hi>Now,</hi> and <hi>Not now.</hi> But all other Men suppose, esteem, and think, <hi>Erewhile,</hi> and <hi>a While hence</hi> to be different parts of Time from <hi>Now,</hi> which is follow'd by the one, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by the other. But <hi>Archedemus,</hi> saying, that <hi>Now</hi> is the Beginning and Juncture of that, which is past, and that, which is near at hand, perceiv'd not ('tis likely) that he thereby took away all Time. For if <hi>Now</hi> is no Time, but only a Term [or Extremity] of Time, and every part of Time is such, as <hi>Now,</hi> all Time seems to have no Parts, but to be wholly dissolv'd into Terms, Joynts, and Beginnings. But <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> desiring to shew more Artifice in his Division, in his [Book] <hi>of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity,</hi> and some others, says, that the past and futur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Time are not, but either have subsisted, or will subsist, and that the present only is; but in his third, fourth, and fifth Book concerning Parts, he asserts, that of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="463" facs="tcp:46327:241"/> present time one part is past, the other to come. Thus it comes to pass, that he divides subsisting Time into non-subsisting [Parts] of a subsisting [Total] or rather leaves nothing at all of Time subsisting, If the present has no part, but what is either future, or past. These Mens Conception therefore of Time is not unlike the Grasping of Water, which, the harder it is held, the more it slides and runs away. As to Actions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all Evidence is utterly confounded. For if <hi>Now</hi> is divided into past and future, 'tis of necessity, that what is now mov'd, partly has been mov'd, and partly shall be mov'd; that the End and Beginning of Motion be taken away; that nothing of any Work has been done first, nor shall any thing be last, the Actions being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed with Time. For as they say, that of Present Time, part is past, and part to come: so of that, which is doing, [it will be said] that part is done, and part shall be done. When therefore had to <hi>Dine,</hi> to <hi>Write,</hi> to <hi>Walk,</hi> a Beginning? when shall they have an End? if every one, who Dines, has Din'd, and shall Dine, and every one, who Walks, has Walk'd, and shall Walk? But this is, as 'tis said, of all Absurdities the most absurd, if he, who now Lives, has already liv'd, and shall live, [for then] to <hi>Live,</hi> neither had Beginning, nor shall have End; but every one of us, as it seems, was born without beginning, and shall dye without ceasing to live. For if there is no last part, but he, who lives, has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the present still remaining for the future; [to say] Socrates <hi>shall live,</hi> will never be false, as long as it shall be true [to say] Socrates <hi>lives;</hi> [and as long as it shall be true to say, Socrates <hi>shall live</hi>] it will be false [to say] Socrates <hi>is dead.</hi> So that if [to say] Socrates <hi>shall live,</hi> is true in infinite parts of Time, it will in no part of Time be true [to say] Socrates <hi>is dead.</hi> And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily what End will there be of a Work? and where will you terminate an Action, if as often, as 'tis true [to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:46327:242"/> say] <hi>This is doing,</hi> 'tis likewise true to say, <hi>This shall be doing?</hi> For he will ly, who shall say, there will be an End of <hi>Plato's</hi> Writing and Disputing: since <hi>Plato</hi> will never give over to [Write and] Dispute, if 'tis never false [to say] of him who disputes, that he shall dispute, and of him who writes, that he shall write. Moreover, there will be no part of that, which now is, but either has been, or is to be, and either past or future; but of what has been, and is to be, of past and future there is no Sense: therefore is absolutely no Sense of any thing. For we neither see, what is past or future, nor do we hear, or have any other Sense of what has been, or is to be. Nor is, what is present, to be perceiv'd by Sense, if of the present part is always future, and part past; part has been, and part is to be.</p>
                  <p>Now they indeed say, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> does intolerable things, and violates the Conceptions in moving all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with equal celerity, and admitting none of them to be swifter than another. And yet it is much more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and farther remote from Sense, that nothing can be overtaken by another,
<q>
                        <l>Not, though <hi>Adrastuses</hi> swift-footed Steed</l>

                     </q> As the Proverb has it. Now this must of necessity fall out, if, things moving according to <hi>Before</hi> and <hi>Behind,</hi> the Intervals [or Spaces] through which they pass, are, as these Mens Tenet is, divisible <hi>in infinitum:</hi> for if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now to affirm, that, Water being pour'd from a Bowl or Cup, it will never be all pour'd out, is it not both
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:46327:242"/> both against common Sense, and a Consequence of what these Men say? For no Man can understand the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to <hi>Before</hi> of things, divisible <hi>in infinitum,</hi> to be consummated; but leaving always somewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, it will make all the Effusion, all the Running and Flux of a Liquid, Motion of a Solid, and Fall of an heavy thing imperfect. I pass by many Absurdities of theirs, touching only such, as are against Sense.</p>
                  <p>The Dispute concerning Increase is indeed ancient: for the Question, as <hi>Chrysippus</hi> says, was put by <hi>Epichar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Now, whereas those of the Academy think, that the Doubt is not very easie, these Men have mightily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd against them, and accus'd them of taking away the Anticipations, and yet themselves are so far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the common Notions, that they pervert even Sense it self. For the Discourse is simple, and these Men grant the Suppositions, that all particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances flow, and are carry'd; some of them emitting forth somewhat from themselves, and others receiving things coming from elsewhere: and that the things, to which there is made an Accession, or from which there is a Decession by Numbers and Multitudes, do not remain the same, but become others by the said Accessions, the Substance receiving a Change: and that these Changes are not rightly call'd by Custom Increasings or Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; when 'tis fitter, they should be stil'd Generations and Corruptions: because they drive by force from one State to another; whereas to increase and be diminish'd are Passions of a Body, that is subject and permanent. These things being thus in a manner said and deliver'd, what would these Defenders of Evidence, and Canonical Reformers of Conceptions have? Every one of us to be double, twin-like, and compos'd of a double Nature: not as the Poets seign'd of the <hi>Molionidae,</hi> that they in some parts grow together, and in some parts are separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but every one of us to have two Bodies, having
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:46327:243"/> the same Colour, the same Figure, the same Weight and Place ** things never before seen by any Man; but these Men alone have discern'd this Composition, Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, and Ambiguity, how every one of us is two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the one in Substance, the other *** and the one is in perpetual Flux and Motion, neither increasing, nor being diminish'd, nor remaining altogether, the other remains, and increases, and is diminish'd, and suffers all things contrary to the former, with which it is concorporate, conjoyn'd and confounded, and exhibits not any difference, to be perceiv'd by Sense. Indeed that <hi>Lynceus</hi> is said to have penetrated Stones and Oaks with his Sight, and a certain Man, sitting on a Watch-Tower in <hi>Sicily,</hi> beheld the Ships of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> setting forth from their Harbor, which was a Days and a Nights Sail from thence. <hi>Callicrates</hi> and <hi>Myrmecides</hi> are said to have made Chariots, that might be cover'd with the Wings of a Fly, and to have engrav'd <hi>Homers</hi> Verses on a Sesam seed. But none ever discern'd or discover'd this Diversity and Motion in us; nor have we perceiv'd our selves to be double, in one part always flowing, and in the other remaining the same from our Birth, even to our Death. But I make the Discourse more simple: since they make four Subjects in every one, or rather every one of us to be four. But two are sufficient to shew their Absurdity. For if, when we hear <hi>Pentheus</hi> in the Tragedy affirm, that he sees two Suns, and two Cities of <hi>Thebes,</hi> we say, that he does not see, but that his Sight dazles, he being transported and troubled in his Discourses: why do we not bid those Farewel, who assert not one City alone, but all Men, and Animals, and all Trees, Vessels, Instruments, and Cloaths, to be double, and compos'd of two, as Men, who constrain us to doat, rather than to understand. But this feigning other Natures of Subjects, must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be pardon'd them: for there appears no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:46327:243"/> by which they can maintain and uphold the Augmentations, of which they are so fond.</p>
                  <p>But by what Cause mov'd, or for the adorning of what other Suppositions, they frame in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Differences and Ideas of Bodies in the Soul, there is none can say, unless it be, that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, or rather wholly abdicate and destroy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and usual Notions, for to introduce other forreign and strange ones. For 'tis very absurd, that making all Vertues, and Vices, and with them, all Arts, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Fancies, Passions, Impulses, and Assents to be Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they should affirm, that they neither lye nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in any Subject, leaving them for a Place one only Hole, like a Prick, in the Heart, where they croud the principal part of the Soul, enclos'd with so many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that a very great number of them lies hid, even from those, who think, they can separate and distinguish them one from another: Nay, that they should not only make them Bodies, but also rational Creatures, and even a Swarm of such Creatures, not friendly or gentle, but a Multitude, rebelling by their Malice against Evidence and Custom. But they say, that not only Virtues and Vices, not only the Passions, as Anger, Envy, Grief, and Maliciousness; not only Comprehensions, Fancies, and Ignorances, nor only Arts, as Shoo-making, and working in Brass are Animals; but besides these, also they make even the Operations Bodies and Animals, [saying, that] Walking is an Animal, as also Dancing, Supposing, Saluting, and Railing. The Consequence of this is, that Laughing and Weeping are also Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; and if so, then also Coughing, Sneezing, Groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Spitting, Blowing the Nose, and other such like things sufficiently known. Neither have they any Cause to take it ill, that they are by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:46327:244"/> argues thus. <hi>Is not Night a Body? And are not then the Evening, Dawning, and Midnight Bodies? Or is not a Day a Body? Is not then the first Day of the Month a Body? and the Tenth, the Fifteenth, and the Thirtieth, [are they not Bodies?] Is not a Month a Body? Summer, Autumn, and the Year, [are they not Bodies?]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things, [which we have already mention'd] they hold against the common Conceptions; but those, which follow, also against their own, engendring that, which is most hot, by refrigeration, and that, which is most subtil, by Condensation. For the Soul, to wit, is [a Substance] most hot, and most subtil. But this they make by the Refrigeration and Condensation of the Body, changing, as it were by Induration, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which of Vegetative is made Animal. Moreover, they say, that the Sun became animated, his Moisture changing into intellectual Fire. Behold how the Sun is imagin'd to be engendred by Refrigeration. <hi>Xenophanes</hi> indeed, when one told him, that he had seen Eels living in hot Water, answer'd, <hi>We will boil them then in cold.</hi> But if these Men engender Heat by Refrigeration, and Lightness by Condensation, it follows, they must also generate cold things by Heat, thick things by Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and heavy things by Rarefaction, that so they may keep some Proportion in their Absurdity.</p>
                  <p>And do they not also determine the Substance and Generation of Conception it self, even against the [com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon] Conceptions? For Conception is a certain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Imagination an Impression in the Soul. Now the Nature of the Soul is an Exhalation, in which it is difficult for an Impression to be made, because of its Tenuity, and for which to keep an Impression, it may have receiv'd, 'tis impossible. For its Nutriment and Generat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> consisting of moist things, has a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Succession and Consumption. And the Mixture of Respiration with the Air, always makes some new
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:46327:244"/> Exhalation, alter'd and chang'd by the Flux of the Air, coming from abroad, and again going out. For one may more Easily imagine, that a Stream of running Water can retain Figures, Impressions, and Images, than a Spirit, which being carry'd in Vapors and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, is continually mingled with another idle and strange Breath from without. But these Men so far forget themselves, that having defin'd the Conceptions to be certain stor'd-up Intelligences and Memories, to be constant and habitual Impressions; and having wholly fixt the Sciences, as having Stability and Firmness, they presently place under them a Basis and Seat of a slippery Substance, easie to be dissipated, and in perpetual Flux and Motion.</p>
                  <p>Now the common Conception of an Element and Principle, naturally imprinted in almost all Men, is this, that it is simple, unmixt, and uncompounded. For that is not an Element or Principle, which is mixt; but those things [are so,] of which it is mixt. But these Men, making God, who is the Principle [of all things] to be an intellectual Body, and a Mind seated in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pronounce him to be neither simple, nor uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, but [to be compos'd] of, and by another. Matter indeed, being of it self without Reason, and void of Quality, has Simplicity, and the Property of a Principle. If then God is not incorporeal and immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, he participates of Matter, as a Principle. For if Matter and Reason are one and the same thing, they have not rightly defin'd Matter to be reasonless; but if they are different things, then is God constituted of them both, and is not a simple, but compound thing, having to the Intellectual taken the Corporeal from Matter.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, calling these four Bodies, Earth, Water, Air and Fire, the first Elements, they do, I know not how, make some of them simple and pure, and other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> compound and mixt; for they hold, that Earth and

How then is either Earth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or Water, an Element, if neither of them is either simple, or first, or self-sufficient; but wanting somewhat from without, to contain and keep it in its Being? For they have not left so much as a Thought of their Substance; but this Discourse concerning the Earth has much Confusion and Uncertainty, [when they say, that it subsists] of it self; for if the Earth is of it self, how has it need of the Air, to fix and contain it? But neither the Earth nor Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can any more be [said to be] of it self; but the Air, drawing together, and thickning the Matter, has made the Earth, and again, dissolving and mollifying it, has produc'd the Water. Neither of these then is an Element, since something else has contributed Being and Generation to them both. Moreover, they say, that Substance and Matter are subject to Qualities, and do so in a manner define them; and again, they make the Qualities to be also Bodies. But these things have much Perplexity; for, if Qualities have a peculiar Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, for which they both are, and are call'd Bodies, they need no other Substance, for they have one of their own. But if they have only under them that, which is common, which they call Essence and Matter, 'tis manifest, they do but participate of the Body, for they are not Bodies. But the Subject and Recipient must of necessity differ from those things, which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, and to which it is subject. But these Men see by halves, for they say indeed, that Matter is void of Quality; but they will not call Qualities immaterial. Now how can they make a Body without Quality, who understand not Quality without a Body? For the reason
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:46327:245"/> which joyns to all Quality a Body, suffers not the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to comprehend any Body without some Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Either therefore he, who oppugns incorporeal Quality, seems also to oppugn unqualify'd Matter; or separating the one from the other, he mutually parts them both. As for the Reason, which some pretend, that Matter is call'd unqualify'd, not because it is void of all Quality, but because it has all Qualities, is most of all against Sense: for no Man calls that unqualify'd, which is uncapable of no Quality; nor that impassible, which is by Nature always apt to suffer all things; nor that immoveable, which is mov'd every way. And this Doubt is not solv'd, that, howsoever Matter is always understood with Quality, yet 'tis understood to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, and differing from Quality.</p>

               <p>I First lay down this for an Axiom, that there [ought to] be seen in Mens Lives an Agreement with their Doctrines. For 'tis not so necessary, that the Pleader (as <hi>Aeschines</hi> has it) and the Law, speak one and the same thing, as that the Life of a Philosopher be consonant to his Speech. For the Speech of a Philosopher is a Law of his own, and voluntarily impos'd on himself, unless they esteem Philosophy to be a Game, or an Acuteness in Disputing [invented] for the gaining of Applause, and not, what it really is, a thing, deserving [our] greatest Study [and Industry.] Since then there are in their Discourses many things written by <hi>Zeno</hi> himself, many by <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> and most of all by <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> concerning Policy, Governing, and being Governed, concerning Judging and Pleading; and yet there is not to be found in any of their Lives, either leading of Armies, making of Laws, going to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pleading before the Judges, fighting for their Country, travelling on Embassies, or bestowing of L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses on the People; but they have all, feeding [If I
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:46327:246"/> may so say] on Rest, as on the <hi>Lotus,</hi> led their whole Lives, and those not short, but very long ones, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries, amongst Disputations, Books, and Walkings: 'tis manifest, that they have liv'd, rather according to the Writings and Sayings of others, than their own Professions, having spent all their Days in that Repose, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Hieronymus</hi> [so much] commend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chrysippus</hi> indeed himself, in his fourth Book <hi>Of Lives,</hi> thinks, there is [little or] no difference between a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick Life, and a voluptuous one. I will set down here his very Words. <hi>They</hi> [says he] <hi>who are of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a Scholastick Life is from the very Beginning, most suitable to Philosophers, seem to me to be in an Error, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they ought to do this for the sake of some Recreation, or some other thing like to it, and in that manner to spin out the whole [Course of their] Life: that is, if it may be explain'd, to live at ease. For this Opinion of theirs is not to be conceal'd, many of them delivering it clearly, and not a few more obscurely.</hi> Who therefore did more grow old in this scholastick [or idle] Life, than <hi>Chrysippus, Cleanthes, Diogenes, Zeno,</hi> and <hi>Antipater?</hi> who left their Countreys, not out of any Discontent, but that they might quietly enjoy their Delight, studying and disputing at their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. [To verifie which] <hi>Aristocreton,</hi> the Disciple, and intimate Friend of <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> having erected his Statue of Brass upon a Pillar, engrav'd on it these Verses.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>This Brasen Statue <hi>Aristocreon</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>To's Friend <hi>Chrysippus</hi> newly here has put,</l>
                  <l>Whose sharp-edg'd Wit, like Sword of Champion,</l>
                  <l>Did <hi>Academick</hi> Knots in sunder cut.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Such an one then was <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> an old Man, a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, one, who prais'd the Regal and Civil Life, and
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:46327:247"/> thought, there is no difference between a scholastick and a voluptuous one.</p>
               <p>But those others of them, who intermeddle in State Affairs, act yet more contradictorily to their own Doctrines; for they govern, judge, consult, make Laws, punish, and honour, as if Those were indeed Cities, in the Government of which they concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; Those truly Counsellors and Judges, who are at any time allotted to such Offices; Those Generals, who are chosen by Suffrages; and Those Laws, which were made by <hi>Clisthenes, Lycurgus,</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> whom they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to have been vitious Men and Fools.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Antipater,</hi> in his Writings concerning the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Cleanthes</hi> and <hi>Chrysippus</hi> has related, that <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Cleanthes</hi> would not be made Citizens of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> lest they might seem to injure their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. I shall not much insist upon it, that, if they did well, <hi>Chrysippus</hi> acted amiss, in suffering himself to be enroll'd, as a Member of that City. But this is very contradictory and absurd, that removing their Persons and their Lives so far off amongst Strangers, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd their Names for their Countreys: [which is the same thing] as if a Man, leaving his Wife, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting and bedding with another, and getting Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on her, should yet refuse to contract Marriage with the second, lest he might seem to wrong the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Again, <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> writing in his Treatise <hi>Of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,</hi> that a wise Man will so plead, and act in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of a Common-wealth, as if Riches, Glory, and Health were [really] good, confesses that his Speeches are inextricable and impolitick, and his Doctrines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable for the Uses and Actions [of human Life.]</p>
               <p>'Tis moreover a Doctrine of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s, that Temples are not to be built to the Gods; for that a Temple is neither a thing of much value, nor holy: since no Work of Carpenters, and Handicrafts Men can be of much value.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:46327:247"/> And yet they, who praise these things, as well [and wisely] said, are initiated in the sacred Mysteries, go up to the Castle, [where <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Temple stands,] adore the Shrines, and adorn with Garlands the Sacraries, being the Works of Carpenters, and mechanical Persons. Again, they think, that the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who sacrifice to the Gods [and yet deny them to meddle with the Government of the World] do thereby refute themselves; whereas they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are more contrary to themselves, sacrificing on Altars and in Temples, which they affirm ought not to stand, nor to have been built.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Zeno</hi> admits, as <hi>Plato</hi> does, several Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues according to their differences, to wit, Prudence, Fortitude, Temperance, and Justice, as being indeed inseparable; but yet divers and different from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But again, defining every one of them, he says, that Fortitude is Prudence in executing, Justice Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in distributing, as being one and the same Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but seeming to differ in its relations to Affairs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording [as they come] to Action. Nor does <hi>Zeno</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone seem to contradict himself in these Matters; but <hi>Chrysippus</hi> also, who blames <hi>Ariston</hi> for saying, that the other [Vertues] are [different] Habits of one and the same Vertue, and yet defends <hi>Zeno,</hi> who in this manner defines every one of the Vertues. And <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Commentaries concerning Nature said, that the Vigor [of things] is the striking of Fire, which, if it is sufficient in the Soul to perform the [Duties] pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to it, is call'd Force and Strength, subjoyns these very Words: <hi>Now this Force and Strength, when it is in things apparent, and to be persisted in, is Continence; when in things to be endur'd, 'tis Fortitude; when about Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, 'tis Justice; and when about Choosing or Refusing; 'tis Temperance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Against him, who said,
<q>
                     <pb n="476" facs="tcp:46327:248"/>Give not thy Judgment, till both Sides are heard,</q>
                  <hi>Zeno</hi> on the contrary made use of such an Argument as this. If he, who spake first, has plainly prov'd [his Cause] the second is not to be heard, for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is at an end; and if he has not prov'd it, 'tis the same Case, as if being cited, he did not appear, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, did [nothing but] wrangle: so that, whether he has prov'd or not prov'd his Cause, the second is not to be heard. And yet he, who made this Dilemma, has written against <hi>Plato</hi>'s Common-weal, dissolv'd So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisms, and exhorted his Scholars to learn Logick, as enabling them to do the same. Now <hi>Plato</hi> has either prov'd, or not prov'd those things [which he writ] in his Common-weal; but in neither Case it was necessary to write against him, but wholly superfluous and vain. The same may be said concerning Sophisms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chrysippus</hi> is of Opinion, that young [Students] should first learn Logick, secondly Ethicks, and, after these, Physicks, and likewise in this, to meddle last of all with the Disputes concerning the Gods. Now these things having been often said by him, 'twill suffice to set down, what is [to that purpose] found in his fourth Book <hi>Of Lives,</hi> being thus word for word. <hi>First then,</hi> says he, <hi>it seems to me, according as it has been rightly said by the Antients, that there are three Kinds of Philosophical Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Logical, Ethical, and Physical, and that of these, the Logical ought to be plac'd first, the Ethical second, and the Physical third, and that of the Physical, the Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Gods ought to be the last: wherefore also the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions concerning this have been stil'd</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>[or the End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.]</hi> But that very Discourse concerning the Gods, which he says ought to be plac'd the last, he usually places first, and sets before every moral Question; for he is seen not to say any thing, either concerning the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:46327:248"/> Ends, or concerning Justice, or concerning Good and Evil, or concerning Marriage and the Education of Children, or concerning the Law and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but, as those, who propose Decrees to States, set before them some Wish of good Fortune, so he also premises something of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Fate, Providence, the Worlds being one, and finite, and maintain'd by one Power. None of which any one can be perswaded to believe, who has not penetrated deeply into the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of Natural Philosophy. Hear what he says of this in his third Book <hi>of the Gods. For there is not,</hi> [says he] <hi>to be found any other Beginning, or any other Generation of Justice, but what is from</hi> Jupiter, <hi>and common Nature. For thence must every such thing have its Beginning, if we will say any thing concerning Good and Evil.</hi> And again in his <hi>Natural Positions</hi> [he says:] <hi>For one cannot otherwise, or more properly come to the Discourse of Good and Evil, to the Vertues, or to Felicity, than from common Nature, and the Administration of the World.</hi> And going farther on, [he adds] <hi>For to these we must annex the Discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good and Evil, there being no other better Beginning or Relation thereof, and the Speculation of Nature being learne for nothing else, but [to understand] the Difference between Good and Evil.</hi> According to <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> therefore the Natural Science is both before and after the Moral: or rather, 'tis an Inversion of Order altogether absurd, if this must be put after those things, none of which can be comprehended without this; and his contradicting himself is manifest, when he asserts the Discourse of Nature to be the Beginning of that concerning Good and Evil, and yet commands it to be deliver'd, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but after it.</p>
               <p>Now if any one shall say, that <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> in his Book <hi>concerning the Ʋse of Speech,</hi> has written, that he, who applies himself to Logick first, needs not absolut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly to abstain from the rest, but should take as much of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:46327:249"/> them, as shall fall in his way, he will indeed say the truth, but will withal confirm the Fault. For he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugns himself, one while commanding, that the Science concerning God should be taken last, and for a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as being therefore also call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and again, another while saying, that this is to be learnt together with the very first. For Order is at an end, if all things must be us'd at all times. But this is more, that having made the Science concerning the Gods the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that concerning Good and Evil, he bids not those, who apply themselves to the Ethicks, to begin with that; but learning these, to take of that also, as it shall come in their way, and then to go from these to that, without which, he says there is no Beginning or Entrance upon these.</p>
               <p>As for disputing on both sides, he says, that he does not universally reject it, but exhorts us to use it with caution, as is done in Pleadings, not with Approbation, but to dissolve their Probability. <hi>For to those,</hi> says he, <hi>who endeavor a Suspension of Assent concerning all things, 'tis convenient to do this, and it cooperates to what they desire; but as for those, who would work in us Science, according to which we shall professedly live, they ought to found the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to direct those, who are entred, from the Beginning to the End; and where there is occasion to make mention of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Discourses, to dissolve their Probability, as is done in Pleadings.</hi> For this he has said in express Words. Now that it is absurd, for Philosophers to think, that they ought to set down the contrary Opinion, not with all its Reasons, but like Pleaders, disabling it, as if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not for Truth, but Victory; we have elsewhere spoken against him. But that he himself has, not [on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] in his Disputations, but frequently confirm'd the Discourses, which are contrary to his own Opinions, [and that] stoutly, and with so much earnestness and Contention, that 'twas not for every one to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:46327:249"/> what he lik'd, they themselves affirm, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Mans Acuteness; and think, that <hi>Carneades</hi> said nothing of his own, but catching hold of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which <hi>Chrysippus</hi> alledg'd for the contrary O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, assaulted with them his Positions, and often cry'd out;
<q>Wretch, thy own Strength will thee undo—</q> As if he had given great Advantages against himself to those, who would disturb and calumniate his Doctrines.</p>
               <p>But of those things, he has set out against Custom, they are so proud, and do so glory [in them,] that they fear not to affirm, that all the Sayings of all the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks</hi> together, if they were collected into one Body, are not comparable to what <hi>Chrysippus</hi> has writ in dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Senses. Which is an evident sign of the Ignorance or Self-love of the Speakers; but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is true, that being afterwards desirous to defend Custom and the Senses, he was inferior to himself, and the latter Treatise was much weaker than the former. So that he contradicts himself: for having always direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the proposing of an Adversaries Opinions, not with Approbation, but with a Demonstration of their Falsity, he has shew'd himself more acute in opposing, then defending his own Doctrines; and having admonish'd others to take heed of contrary Arguments, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing Comprehension, he has been more sedulous in framing such Proofs, as take away Comprehension, than such, as confirm it. And yet he plainly shews, that he himself fear'd this, writing thus in his fourth Book <hi>of Lives. Repugnant Arguments, and Probabilities on the contrary side, are not [rashly] to be propos'd, but with caution, lest [the Hearers,] distracted by them, should let go their Conception, not being able sufficiently to apprehend their Solutions, but so
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:46327:250"/> weakly, that their Comprehensions may easily be shaken. For even those, who have, according to custom, preconceiv'd both sensible and other things, quickly forego them, being distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by</hi> Megarian <hi>Interrogatories, and others more numerous and forcible.</hi> I would willingly therefore ask the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> whether they think these <hi>Megarian</hi> Interrogatories to be more forcible than those, which <hi>Chrysippus</hi> has written in six Books against Custom, or [rather] this should be askt of <hi>Chrysippus</hi> himself. For observe, what he has written about the <hi>Megarian</hi> Reason, in his Book <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Ʋse of Speech,</hi> [where he says] thus: <hi>Some such things fell out in the Discourse of</hi> Stilpon <hi>and</hi> Menede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus: <hi>for, whereas they were renown'd for Wisdom, their Disputing has turn'd to their Reproach, [their Arguments] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part clumsie, and the rest evidently sophistical.</hi> And yet, good Sir, you fear, lest those Arguments, which you deride, and term the Disgrace of their Proposers, as having a manifest Faultiness, should divert some from Comprehension. And did not you your self, writing so many Books against Custom, in which you have added, whatever you could invent, ambitiously striving to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> expect, that you should perplex some of your Readers? For neither does he use slender Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against Custom, but, as if he were Pleading, he with some Passion [in himself] stirs up the Affections [of others,] telling [his Opponent,] that he talks foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and labours in vain. And that he may leave no room to deny his speaking of Contradictions, he has in his <hi>Natural Positions</hi> written thus. <hi>It may be lawful for those, who comprehend a thing, to argue on the contrary side, applying it to the Defence, which is in the thing it self; and sometimes, when they comprehend neither, to discourse, what is [alledg'd] for either.</hi> And having said in his Book <hi>Concerning the Ʋse of Speech,</hi> that we ought no more to use the Force of Reason, than of Arms, for such things as are not fitting, he subjoyns this: <hi>For they are to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:46327:250"/> for the finding out of Truths, and for the Alliance of them, and not for the contrary, though many Men do it.</hi> By the <hi>Many,</hi> perhaps he means those, who withhold [their Assent.] But they indeed, comprehending neither, argue on both sides, as may be perceiv'd: for thus only, or chiefly, does Truth afford a Comprehension of it self. But you, who accuse them, and do your self write con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to those things, which you comprehend concerning Custom, and exhort others with Approbation to do the same in unprofitable and hurtful things, confess, that using the Faculty of Disputing, you, through Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on act like a young Scholar.</p>
               <p>They say, that a good Deed is the Command, and Sin the Prohibition of the Law; and therefore that the Law forbids the Wicked many things, but commands them nothing, because they cannot do a good Deed. But who is ignorant, that he, who cannot do a good Deed, cannot also sin? Therefore they make the Law to contradict it self, commanding Men those things, which they cannot perform, and forbidding them those things, from which they cannot abstain. For a Man, who cannot be temperate, cannot but act intemperately; and he, who cannot be wise, cannot but act foolishly. And they themselves affirm, that those who forbid, say in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one thing, forbid another, and command another. For he, who says, <hi>Thou shalt not steal,</hi> [at the same time, that] he says this Word, <hi>Thou shalt not steal,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids also to steal. The Law therefore forbids the Wicked nothing, unless it also commands them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And they say, that the Physician [or Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion] bids his Disciple [or Apprentice] to cut and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terize, without adding these Words, <hi>Seasonably</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately;</hi> and the Musician commands his Scholar to play on the Harp, and Sing, without adding, <hi>Tuneably,</hi> and <hi>keeping Time.</hi> Wherefore also they punish those, who do these things unskilfully and faultily: for that they
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:46327:251"/> were commanded to do them well, and they have done them ill. If therefore a wise Man commands his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to say, or do something, and punishes him for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unseasonably, or not as he ought, is it not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that he commanded him to do a good Action, and not an indifferent one? But if wise Men command wicked ones indifferent things, what hinders, but the Commands of the Law may be also such? Moreover, the Instinct, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is, according to him, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Man, commanding him to do something, as he has written in his Book <hi>Of the Law.</hi> Is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also the Aversion, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a prohibiting Reason, and an Inclination, and that Inclination agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reason? Caution therefore is also Reason, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting a wise Man: for to be cautious, is proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Wise, and not to the Wicked. If then the Reason of a wise Man is one thing, and the Reason of the Law another, wise Men have caution contrary to the Law; but if the Law is nothing else, but the Reason of a wise Man, the Law is found to forbid wise Men the doing of those things, of which they are cautious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chrysippus</hi> says, that nothing is profitable to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Wicked have neither use nor need of any thing. Having said this in his first Book <hi>Of Good Deeds,</hi> he says again, that both Commodiousness and Grace pertain to mean [or indifferent] things, none of which, according to them, is profitable. In the same place he affirms, that there is nothing proper, nothing conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a vitious Man: and consequently, that there is nothing strange [or unfitting] for a good Man, nothing familiar or fitting for a bad one: since, as Goodness is the ones, so Badness is the others. Why then does he break our Heads, writing particularly in every one of his Books, as well Natural as Moral, that as soon as we are born, we are appropriated to our selves, our Parts,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:46327:251"/> Off-spring? And why in his first Book <hi>Of Justice</hi> does he say, that the very Brutes, proportionably to the Necessity of their Young, are appropriated [or affected] to them, except Fishes, for their Young are nourish'd by themselves? For neither have they Sense, who have nothing sensible, nor they Appropriation, who have nothing proper: for Appropriation seems to be the Sense and Perception of what is proper. And this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is consequent to their principal ones.</p>
               <p>'Tis moreover manifest, that <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> though he has also written many things to the contrary, lays this for a Position, that there is not any Vice greater, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sin more grievous than another; nor any Vertue more excellent, or any good Deed better than another: so that he says in his first Book <hi>Of Nature: As it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seems</hi> Jupiter <hi>to glory in himself and his Life, to magnifie himself, and (if we may so say) to bear up his Head, have an high Conceit of himself, and speak big, for that he leads a Life worthy of lofty Speech: so the same things do not mis-beseem all good Men, who are in nothing exceeded by</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter. And yet himself, in his third Book <hi>Of Justice</hi> says, that they, who make Pleasure the End, destroy Justice; but they, who say, 'tis only a Good, do not destroy it. These are his very Words: <hi>For perhaps, if we leave this to Pleasure, that 'tis a Good, but not the End, and that Honesty is [one] of those things, which are eligible for themselves; we may preserve Justice, making Honest and Just a greater Good than Pleasure. But if that is only good, which is honest, he, who affirms Pleasure to be a Good, is in an Error, but he errs less than he who makes it also the End: for the one destroys Justice, the other preserves it; and by the one [human] Society is overthrown, but the other leaves a Place to Goodness and Humanity.</hi> Now I let pass his saying far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Book <hi>Concerning</hi> Jupiter, that the Vertues increase and go on, lest I may seem to catch at Words; though <hi>Chrysippus</hi> indeed is in this kind very sharp upon
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:46327:252"/>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> and others. But when he forbids the praising of every thing, that is done according to Vertue, he shews that there is some difference between good Deeds. Now he says thus in his Book <hi>Concerning</hi> Jupiter: <hi>For of Works that are according to Vertue, the principal only are to be prais'd; for he would show himself to be very frigid, that should undertake to praise and extol any Men for holding out the Finger sloutly, for abstaining continently from an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ready to drop into the Grave, and patiently hearing [it said,] that three are not exactly four.</hi> What he says in his third Book <hi>of the Gods,</hi> is not unlike to this: <hi>For I more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over think,</hi> says he, <hi>that the Praises of such things, though proceeding from Vertue, as are to abstain from an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who has one Foot in the Grave, and to endure the Stinging of a Wasp, would be very impertinent.</hi> What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reprehender of his Doctrines does this Man then expect? For if he, who praises such things, is frigid, he, who asserts every one of them to be a great, nay, a very great good Deed, is much more frigid. For if to bear the Stinging of a Wasp is equal to the being Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant; and to abstain from an old Woman, who is neer her End, to the being Temperate; there is, I think, no difference whether a vertuous Man is prais'd for these, or for those. Moreover, in his second Book <hi>of Friendship,</hi> teaching, that Friendships are not for every Fault to be dissolv'd, he has these very Expressions: <hi>For 'tis meet that some [Faults] should be wholly pass'd by, others lightly reprehended, others more severely, and others deem'd worthy a total Dissolution [Of Friendship.]</hi> And which is more, he says in the same Book, that we will converse with some more, and some less, so that some are more, and some less Friends; this Diversity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending very far: for some are worthy of such an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, others of a greater; and these will deserve to be so far trusted, those not so far, and the like. For what else has he done in these Places, but shewn the great
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:46327:252"/> Diversities, there are between these things? Moreover, in his Book <hi>Concerning Honesty,</hi> to demonstrate that only to be good, which is honest, he uses these Words: <hi>What is good, is eligible; what is eligible, is acceptable; what is acceptable, is laudable; and what is laudable, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.</hi> And again, <hi>What is good, is joyous; what is joyous, is venerable; what is venerable, is honest.</hi> But these Speeches are repugnant to himself: for either all Good is commendable, and then the abstaining chastly from an old Woman is also commendable; or all Good is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venerable, nor joyous, but this Reason is at an end. Or may it perhaps be frigid in others, to praise any for such things, and not ridiculous for him to rejoyce and glory in them?</p>
               <p>Such indeed he frequently is; but in his Disputations against others he takes not the least care of speaking things contrary and dissonant to himself. For in his Books <hi>Of Exhorting</hi> reprehending <hi>Plato,</hi> who said, that to him, who has neither learnt, nor knows how to live, 'tis profitable not to live; he speaks in this manner: <hi>For this Speech is both repugnant to it self, and not at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortatory: for first insinuating, that 'tis best for us not to live, and in a sort counselling us to dye, he will excite us rather to any thing else, than to be Philosophers: for neither can he, who does not live, philosophize, nor he, who shall live long wickedly and ignorantly, become wise.</hi> And going on, he says, that 'tis convenient for the Wicked also to continue in Life. And afterwards thus word for word: <hi>First [as] Vertue, barely [taken,] has nothing towards our Living; so neither has Vice any thing to oblige us to depart.</hi> Nor is it necessary to turn over other Books, that we may shew <hi>Chrysippus</hi>'s Contradictoriness to himself; but in these same he sometimes with Commendation brings forth this Saying of <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> that either <hi>Ʋnderstanding, or an Halter, is to be provided;</hi> as also that of <hi>Tyrtaeus,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="486" facs="tcp:46327:253"/>Come nigh the Bounds of Vertue, or of Death.</q> Now what else will this shew, but that to wicked Men and Fools, not to live is more profitable than to live? And sometimes correcting <hi>Theogni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> he says, that the Poet should not have written,
<q>From Poverty to fly—</q> But rather thus;
<q>
                     <l>From Wickedness to fly, into the Deep</l>
                     <l>Throw thy self, <hi>Cyrnus,</hi> or from Rocks so steep.</l>
                  </q> What therefore else does he seem to do, but to set down himself those things and Doctrines, which, when others write them, he expunges: condemning indeed <hi>Plato,</hi> for shewing, that not to live, is better than to live vitiously and ignorantly; and yet with <hi>Theoguis</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling a Man to break his Neck, or throw himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, that he may avoid Vice? For having prais'd <hi>Antisthenes</hi> for directing Fools to an Halter, he again blames him, saying, that Vice has nothing that should oblige us to depart out of Life.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in his Books against the same <hi>Plato, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Justice,</hi> he immediately, at the very beginning, leaps into a Discourse touching the Gods, and says, that <hi>Cephalus</hi> did not rightly avert Men from Injustice by the Fear of the Gods, and that he may easily be refuted, and that he affords to the contrary many Arguments and Probabilities, impugning the Discourse concerning Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Punishments, as nothing differing from the Tales of <hi>Acco</hi> and <hi>Alphito,</hi> [or <hi>Raw-Head</hi> and <hi>Bloody-Bones,</hi>] with which Women are wont to frighten little Children from their unlucky Pranks. Having thus traduc'd <hi>Plato,</hi> he
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:46327:253"/> in other places again praises him, and often alledges this Saying of <hi>Euripides.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>And likewise in his first Book <hi>of Justice</hi> citing these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Hesiod,</hi>

                     <l>Then <hi>Jove</hi> from Heaven Punishments did send,</l>

                  </q> He says, the Gods do these things, that, the Wicked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing punisht, others, admonisht by these Examples, may less dare to attempt the doing of such things.</p>
               <p>Again, in his Book <hi>of Justice,</hi> subjoyning, that 'tis possible for those, who make Pleasure a Good, but not the End, to preserve also Justice, he said in express Terms: <hi>For perhaps if we leave this to Pleasure, that 'tis a Good, but not the End, and that Honesty is one of those things, which are eligible for themselves, we may preserve Justice, making Honest and Just a greater Good than Pleasure.</hi> So much [he says] in this Place concerning Pleasure. But in his Book against <hi>Plato,</hi> accusing him for seeming to make Health a Good, he says, that not only <hi>Justice, but also Magnanimity, Temperance, and all the other Vertues will be taken away, if we make Pleasure, Health, or any thing else, which is not Honest, to be a Good.</hi> What therefore is to be said for <hi>Plato,</hi> we have elsewhere written against him. But here his contradicting himself is manifest, when he says in one place, that if a Man supposes, with Honesty, Pleasure also to be a Good, Justice is preserv'd; and in another, accuses those who make any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Honesty, to be a Good, of taking away all the Vertues. But that he may not leave [any Means of making] an Apology for his Contradictions, writing
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:46327:254"/> against <hi>Aristotle Concerning Justice,</hi> he affirms him not to have spoken rightly, when he said, that Pleasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [made] the End, Justice is taken away, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Justice, every one also of the other Vertues. For that Justice will indeed be taken away; but that there is nothing to hinder the other Vertues from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and being, though not eligible for themselves, yet good, and Vertues. Then he reckons up every one of them by Name. But ['twill be] better to set down his own Words. <hi>For Pleasure,</hi> says he, <hi>appearing, according to this Discourse [to be made] the End, yet all this seems not to me to be contain'd in it. Wherefore we must say, that neither any of the Vertues is eligible, nor any of the Vices to be avoided for it self, but that all these things are to be refer'd to the proposed Scope. Yet nothing, according to their Opinion, will hinder, but that Fortitude, Prudence, Continence, and Patience, may be good, and their Contraries to be avoided.</hi> Has there ever then been any Man more peevish in his Disputes than he, who has blam'd two of the principal Philosophers; the one for taking away all Vertue, by not making that only to be good, which is honest; and the other, for not thinking all the Vertues, except Justice, to be preserv'd, though Pleasure is [made] the End. For 'tis a wonderful Licentiousness, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of the same Matters, he should, [when] ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing <hi>Plato,</hi> take away again those very things, which himself sets down, [when] reprehending <hi>Aristotle.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in his <hi>Demonstrations concerning Justice,</hi> he says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that every good Deed is both a lawful Action, and a just Operation; but every thing which is done according to Continence, Patience, Prudence, or Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is a good Deed, and therefore also a just Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Why then does he not also leave Justice to them, to whom he leaves Prudence, Fortitude, and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; since whatever they do well according to the said Vertue, they do also justly?</p>
               <pb n="489" facs="tcp:46327:254"/>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Plato</hi> having said, that Injustice, as being the Corruption and Sedition of the Soul, loses not its Power even in those, who have it within them; but sets the wicked Man against himself, and molests, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbs him: <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> blaming this, affirms, that 'tis absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, a Man injures himself: for that Injustice is to another, and not to ones self. But forgetting this, he again says in his <hi>Domonstrations concerning Justice,</hi> that the unjust Man is injur'd by himself, and injures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when he injures another, becoming to himself the Cause of Transgressing, and undeservedly hurting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. In his Books indeed against <hi>Plato</hi> contending, that Injustice is not said against ones self, but against another, he has these Words. <hi>For those who are particularly unjust, consist of many such, speaking contrary things; Injustice also being besides so taken, as to be in many, so affected to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and no such thing extending to one alone, but inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is affected towards his Neighbour.</hi> But in his <hi>Demonstrations</hi> he has such Discourses, as these, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unjust Mans being injurious also to himself: <hi>The Law forbids the being any way the Author [or Cause] of Transgression; and to act injustly will be a Transgression: He Therefore, who is to himself the Author [or Cause] of acting injustly, transgresses against himself. Now he that transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against any one, also injures him; therefore he, who is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to any one whomsoever, is injurious also to himself.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Sin is an Hurt, and every one, who sins, sins against himself; every one therefore, who sins, hurts himself undeserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and if so, is also unjusts to himself.</hi> And farther thus: <hi>He, who is hurt by another, hurts himself, and that undeserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. Now that is to be unjust. Every one therefore, that is injur'd, by whomsoever it is, is unjust also to himself.</hi> He says, that the Doctrine concerning Good and Evil, which himself introduces and approves, is most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Life, and does most of all reach the inbred Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notions; for this he has affirm'd in his third Book <hi>Of Exhortations.</hi> But in his first Book, he says, that this
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:46327:255"/> Doctrine takes a Man off from all other things, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>othing to us, nor co-operating any thing towards Felicity. See now, how consonant he is to himself, when he asserts [a Doctrine,] which takes us off from Life, Health, Indolence, and Integrity of the Senses, and says, that those things, we beg of the Gods, are nothing to us, to be most agreeable to Life, and to the common Anticipations. But that there may be no Denial of his speaking Contradictions, in his third Book <hi>Of Justice</hi> he has said thus: <hi>Wherefore also for the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their Greatness and Beauty, we seem to speak things, like to Fictions, and not according to Man or Human Nature.</hi> Is it then possible that any one can more plainly confess his speaking things contrary to himself, than this Man does, who affirms those things, which he says for their Excellency seem to be Fictions, and to be spoken above Man, and Human Nature, to be agreeable to Life, and most of all to reach the inbred Praenotions?</p>
               <p>In every one of his Natural and Ethical Books, he asserts Vice to be the very Essence of Unhappiness: writing and contending, that to live vitiously is the same thing as to live unhappily. But in his third Book <hi>Of Nature,</hi> having said, that 'tis profitable for a Fool to live, rather than to dy, though he is never to become Wise, he subjoyns: <hi>For such are good things to Men, that evil things do in some sort precede indifferent ones.</hi> I let pass therefore, that having elsewhere said, Nothing is profitable to Fools, he here says, that to live foolishly is profitable to them. Now those things being by them call'd indifferent, which are neither bad nor good, when he says, that bad things precede them, he says nothing else, but that evil things precede those, that are not evil, and that to be unhappy is more profitable than not to be Unhappy; and if so, he esteems not to be unhappy to be more unprofitable; and if more unprofitable, more hurtful than to be unhappy. Desiring therefore to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate this Absurdity, he adds concerning Evils: <hi>But 'tis
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:46327:255"/> not these Evils that prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de, but Reason, with which 'tis more con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enient to live, though we shall be Fools.</hi> First therefore he says, that Vice, and things participating of Vice, are Evil; and that nothing else [is so.] Now Vice is something reasonable, or rather deprav'd Reason. For those therefore, who are Fools, to live with Reason, is nothing else but to live with Vice: thence to live being Fools, is to live being unhappy. In what then does this precede indifferent things? For he meant not, that to be happy, does by Nature precede to be unhappy. But neither, say they, does <hi>Chrysippus</hi> altogether think, that the remaining in Life is to be reckon'd amongst good things, or the going out of it amongst bad; but both of them amongst indifferent ones according to Nature. Wherefore also it sometimes becomes meet for the Happy to make themselves away, and again for the Unhappy to continue in Life. Now what greater Repugnance can there be than this in the Choice and avoiding of Things, if 'tis convenient for those, who are in the highest degree happy, to forsake those good things, that are present, for the want of some one indifferent thing? And yet they esteem none of the indifferent things either desirable, or to be avoided; but only Good desirable, and Evil only to be avoided. So that it comes to pass according to them, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings about Actions are plac'd neither upon things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable, nor upon things refusable; but that aiming at other things, which they neither shun nor choose, they live and dye according to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chrysippus</hi> confesses, that good things are totally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from bad, and it must of necssity be so, if these make them, with whom they are present, miserable to the very utmost Point, and those [render their Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors] in the highest degree happy. Now he says, that good and evil things are sensible, writing thus in his first Book <hi>Of the End: That good and evil things are percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:46327:256"/> by Sense, we are by these [Reasons] forc'd to say: for not only the Passions with their Species, as Sorrow, Fear, and such others, are sensible; but we may also have a Sense of Theft, Adultery, and the like, and generally of Folly, Cowardise, and other Vices not a few,: And again, not only of Joy, Beneficence, and many other Dependencies on good Deeds, but also of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Fortitude, and the other Vertues.</hi> Let us pass by the other Absurdities of these things; but that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to those [things, which are deliver'd by him] concerning a wise Man, that knows nothing of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, who does not confess? For Good, when present, being sensible, and having a great difference from Evil, is it not most absurd, that he, who is of Bad become Good, should be ignorant of it, and not perceive Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue when present, but think, that Vice is still within him? For either none, who has all Vertues, can be ignorant, and doubt [of his having them;] or the Difference of Vertue from Vice, of Happiness from Misery, and of a most honest Life from a most shameful one, is little, and altogether difficult to be discern'd, if he, who pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses the one for the other, does not perceive it.</p>
               <p>[He has written] one Volume <hi>of Lives,</hi> [divided into] four Books: in the fourth of these, he says, that a wise Man meddles with no Business but his own, and is imploy'd about his own Affairs. His Words are these: <hi>For I am of Opinion, that a prudent Man shuns Affairs, meddles little, and at the same time minds his own Occasions, civil Persons being both Minders of their own Affairs, and Medlers with little [else.]</hi> He has said almost the same in his Book <hi>Of things eligible for themselves,</hi> in these very Words: <hi>For indeed a quiet Life seems to have [in it] a certain Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Danger and Security, though there are not very many, who can comprehend it.</hi> 'Tis manifest, that he does not much dissent from <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who takes away Providence, that he may leave God in Repose. But the same <hi>Chrysippus</hi> in his first Book <hi>Of Lives</hi> says, That
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:46327:256"/> a wise Man willingly takes upon him a Kingdom, making his Profit by it, and if he cannot reign himself, will dwell with a King, and go with him to the Wars, [though he be] such an one as was <hi>Hydanthyrsus</hi> the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> or <hi>Leucon</hi> the <hi>Pontick.</hi> [But] I will [here] also set down his very Discourse, that we may see, whether, as from the Treble and the Bass Strings there arises a Symphony in Musick, so the Life of a Man, who chooses Quietness, and Medling with little, accords with him, who upon any necessity rides along with the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> and manages the Affairs of the Tyrants in the <hi>Bosphorus: For,</hi> says he, <hi>that [a wise Man] will both go to the Wars, and live with Potentates, we will again consider this hereafter; some indeed upon the like Arguments, not so much as suspecting these things, and we for semblable Reasons admitting them.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Not only with those, who have proceeded well, and are become [Proficients] in discipline and [good] Manners, as with</hi> Leucon <hi>and</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danthyrsus.</p>
               <p>Some there are, who blame <hi>Callisthenes</hi> for sailing to <hi>Alexander,</hi> in hopes to obtain the Re-building of <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> [had procur'd that] of <hi>Stagira;</hi> and commend <hi>Ephorus, Xenocrates,</hi> and <hi>Menedemus,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <hi>Alexander.</hi> But <hi>Chrysippus</hi> thrusts [his] wise Man Head forwards for the sake of Gain, as far as <hi>Panticape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and the Desert of the <hi>Scythians.</hi> And that he does this for the sake of Profit and Gain, he has shew'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, supposing three ways of gaining most suitable for a wise Man: the first by a Kingdom, the second by his Friends, and the third, besides these, by [teaching of] Literature. And yet he frequently, even tires us with his Praises of this Saying:
<q>What need have Men of more, than these two things?</q>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:46327:257"/> But in his Books <hi>Of Nature,</hi> he says, that wise Man, if he has lost the greatest Wealth [imaginable, values it so little, that he] seems to have lost [but] a single Groat. But having there thus elevated and pufft him up, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain here throws him down to Mercinariness, and [teaching of] Sophistry; nay, even to asking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving beforehand, sometimes at the very entrance of his Scholar, and otherwhiles after some time past: which he says indeed to be the more civil, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive before hand the more sure, Delay being subject to sustain Injuries: Now he says thus: <hi>All, who are well advis'd, do not require their Salary in the same manner, but differently: a Multitude of them, as Opportunity offers, not promising to make [their Scholars] good Men, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Year; but to do this, as far as in them lies, within a time agreed on.</hi> And again, going on, [he says:] <hi>But he will know his Opportunity, whether he ought to receive his Recompence presently at the very Entrance, (as many have done) or to give them Time, this Manner being more liable to Injuries, but withal, seeming the more courteous.</hi> And how is the wise Man a Contemner of Wealth, who upon a Contract delivers Vertue for Money, and if he has not deliver'd it, yet requires his Reward, as having done what is in him? Or how is he above being endammag'd, when he is so cautious, lest he be wrong'd of his Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence? For no Man is wrong'd, who is not endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mag'd. Therefore, though he has elsewhere assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a wise Man cannot be injur'd, he here says, that this manner [of Dealing] is liable to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
               <p>In his Book <hi>Of a Common-weal</hi> he says, that his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens will neither act, nor prepare any thing for the sake of Pleasure, and praises <hi>Euripides</hi> for having ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd this Sentence:

Moreover, having in his Books <hi>Of Nature</hi> written, that Nature has produc'd many Creatures for the Sake of Beauty, delighting in Pulchritude, and pleasing her self with Variety, and having added a most absurd Expression, that the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock was made for the sake of his Tail, and for the Beauty of it: he has in his Treatise <hi>Of a Common-weal</hi> sharply reprehended those, who breed Peacocks and Nightingales, as if he were making Laws contrary to the Law-giver of the World, and deriding Nature for pleasing her self in the Beauty [and Production] of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch Animals, to which a wise Man would not give a Place in his City. For how can it but be absurd to blame those, who nourish these Creatures, if he commends Providence, [which created them?] In his Fifth Book <hi>Of Nature,</hi> having said, that Bugs profitably awaken us out of our Sleep, that Mice make us cautious not to lay up every think negligently, and that 'tis probable, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rejoycing in Variety, takes delight in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of fair Creatures, he adds these Words: <hi>The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of this is chiefly shewn in the Peacocks Tail: for here she manifests, that this Animal was made for the sake of his Tail, and not the contrary: so, the Male being made, the Female follow'd.</hi> In his Book <hi>Of a Common-weal,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing said, that we are ready to paint even Dunghils, a
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:46327:258"/> little after he adds, that some beautifie their Corn-fields with Vines, climbing up Trees, and Myrtles set in rows, and keep Peacocks, Doves, and Partridges, that they may [hear them] cry and cooe, and Nightingales [to hear them sing.] Now I would gladly ask him, what he thinks of Bees and Honey. For 'twas of Consequence, that he, who said, Bugs were created profitably, should also say, that Bees were created unprofitably. But if he allows these a Place in his City, why does he drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Citizens from things, that are pleasing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Ear? To be brief, as he would be very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, who should blame the Guests for eating Sweet-meats, and other Delicacies, and drinking of Wine; and at the same time commend him, who invited them, and prepar'd such things for them: so he, that praises Providence, which has afforded Fishes, Birds, Honey, and Wine, and at the same time finds fault with those, who reject not these things, nor content themselves with
<q>The Fruits of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and thirst-quenching Springs,</q> Which are present, and sufficient to nourish us, seems to make no Scruple of speaking things, contradictory to himself.</p>
               <p>Moreover, having said in his Book <hi>of Exhortations,</hi> that the having carnal Commerce with our Mothers, Daughters, or Sisters, the Eating any sort of Food, and the Going from a [Womans] Bed, or a dead Carcase to the Temple, have been without reason blam'd, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that we ought for these things to have a Regard to the brute Beasts, and from what is done by them, conclude, that none of these is absurd, or contrary to Nature. For that the Comparisons of other Animals are fitly made for this Purpose, [to shew,] that neither their Coupling, Bringing forth, nor dying in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:46327:258"/> pollutes the Divinity. Yet he again in his Fifth Book <hi>Of Nature</hi> says, that <hi>Hesiod</hi> rightly forbids the Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing into Rivers and Fountains; and that we should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abstain from making Water against any Altar, or Statue of the Gods; and that 'tis not to be admitted for an Argument, that Dogs, Asses, and young Children do it, who have no Discretion or Consideration of such things. 'Tis therefore absurd to say in one place, that the Savage Example of irrational Animals is fit [to be consider'd,] and in another, that 'tis unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable [to alledge it.]</p>
               <p>To give a Solution to the Inclinations, when a Man seems to be necessitated by exterior Causes, some Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers place in the principal Faculty of the Soul, a certain adventitious Motion, which is chiefly manifested in dubious things, compar'd with one another. For when of two things, altogether alike, and of equal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, there is a Necessity to choose the one, there being no Cause inclining to either, for that neither of them differs from the other, this adventitious Power of the Soul, seizing on its Inclination, determins the Doubt. <hi>Chrysippus</hi> discoursing against these Men, as offering Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Nature by the contrary, in many [Places] al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Dy and the Ballance, and several [other] things, which cannot fall, or bend, either one way or other, without some Cause or Difference, either wholly within them, or coming to them from without: For that what is causeless, is wholly insubsistent, as also what is fortuitous; and that in those Motions, devi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

These are some of those things, which are most evidently known to have been frequently said by him; but what he has said contrary to this, not lying so expos'd to every ones Sight, I will set down in his own Words. For in his
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:46327:259"/> Book <hi>Of Judging,</hi> having suppos'd two, running [for a Wager,] to have exactly finish'd their Race together, he examines what is fit for the Judge [in this Case] to do. <hi>Whether,</hi> says he, <hi>may the Judge give the Palm to which of them he will, although they both happen to be so familiar to him, that he would in some sort rather bestow on them somewhat of his own, [than deprive them of what is theirs:] so that, the Palm being common to both, may he, as if Lots had been cast, give it to either, according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, he chances to have? I say the Inclination, he chances to have, such, as when, two Groats, every way else alike, being presented to us, we incline to one of them, and take it.</hi> And in his sixth Book <hi>Of Duties,</hi> having said, that there are some things not worthy of much Study or Attention, he thinks we ought, as if we had cast Lots, to commit the Choice of those things to the casual Inclination of the Mind: <hi>As if,</hi> says he, <hi>of those, who try the same two Groats, some should say this, and others that to be good, and there being no more Cause for the taking of one than the other, we should leave off making any farther Enquiry into their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and take that, which chances [to come first to hand]</hi> In another place he says, that casting Lots for this, we shall yet [perhaps] take the worst of them. For in these Passages, the Casting of Lots, and the casual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of the Mind, which is without any Cause, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces the [Choice, or] Taking of indifferent things.</p>
               <p>In his third Book <hi>Of Logick,</hi> having said, that <hi>Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and [those, who came] after them, even to <hi>Polemon</hi> and <hi>Straton,</hi> but especially <hi>Socratos,</hi> diligently study'd Logick, and having cry'd out, that one would even choose to erre with these, such and so great Men, he brings in these Words: <hi>For if they had spoken of these things cursorily, one might perhaps have cavil'd at this place; but having treated of Logick, as one of the greatest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For ['tis not probable] that they writ seriously of Logick, and [only] transitorily, and in sport, of the Beginning, End, Gods and Justice; in which you affirm their Discourse to be blind, and contradictory to it self, and to have a thousand other faults.</p>
               <p>In one place he says, that [the Vice, call'd by the <hi>Greeks</hi>] <gap reason="foreign">

But in his second Book <hi>Of Good,</hi> having declar'd Envy to be a Sorrow at other Mens Good, to wit, in such as desire the Depression of their Neighbours, that themselves may excel, he joyns to it this Rejoycing at other Mens Harms, [saying thus:] <hi>To this is contiguous the Rejoycing at other Mens Harms, in such, as for like Causes desire to have their Neighbours low; but in those, that are turn'd according to other natural Motions, is ingendred Mercy.</hi> For he manifestly admits the Joy at other Mens Harms to be subsistent, as well as Envy and Mercy, though in other places he affirms it to have no subsistence; as [he does] also the Hatred of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and the Desire of dishonest Gain.</p>
               <p>Having in many places said, that those, who have a long time been happy, are nothing more so, but equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in like manner with those, who have but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been Partakers of Felicity, he has again in many other places affirm'd, that 'tis not fit to stretch out so much as a Finger for [the obtaining] momentary Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which flies away like a Flash of Lightning. 'Twill be sufficient to set down, what is to this purpose written by him in his sixth Book <hi>Of Moral Questions.</hi> For having said, that every good thing does neither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:46327:260"/> cause Joy, nor every good Deed [the like] Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, he subjoyns these [Words:] <hi>For if a Man should be to have Wisdom only for a Moment of Time, or the last Minute of Life, he ought not so much as to stretch out his Finger for such a short-liv'd Prudence, though Men are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more happy for being longer so, nor is eternal Felicity more eligible than that, which lasts but a Moment.</hi> If he had indeed held Prudence to be a Good, producing Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> thought, one should have blam'd only the Absurdity and the Paradoxicalness of this Opinion; but since Prudence of it self is not another thing [differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] from Felicity, but Felicity it self; how is it no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Chrysippus</hi> also says, that the Vertues follow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that not only he, who has one, has all, but also that he, who acts according to any one of them, acts according to them all; and he affirms, that there is not any Man perfect, who is not possess'd of all the Vertues, nor any Action perfect, to the doing of which all the Vertues do not concur. But yet in his sixth Book <hi>Of Moral Questions</hi> he says, that a good Man does not always act valiantly, nor a vitious Man always fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; for Certain Objects being presented to the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the one must persist in his Judgments, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depart from them: and he says, that 'tis not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, a wicked Man should be always indulging his Lust. If then to act valiantly is the same thing as to use Fortitude, and to act timorously, as to yield to Fear, they [cannot but] speak Contradictions, who say, that he, who is possess'd [of either Vertue or Vice] acts at the same time according to all the Vertues, or [all the] Vices, and yet that a valiant Man does not always act valiantly, nor a vitious Man timorously.</p>

               <p>He defines Rhetorick to be an Art concerning the Ornament, and the ordering of a Discourse, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. And farther in his first Book he has written thus: <hi>And I am of Opinion, that there ought not a Regard to be had to a liberal and simple adorning of Words; but also [that Care is to be taken] for proper Gestures, according to the interjected Stops of the Voice, and the Compositions of the Countenance and Hands.</hi> Yet he, who is in this place so curious and exact, again in the same Book, speaking of the Collision of the Vowels, says: <hi>We ought not only, to let these things pass, minding [somewhat, that is] better, but also [to neglect] certain Obscurities and Defects, nay, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecisms also, of which others, [and those] not a few, would be asham'd.</hi> Certainly in one place to allow those, who would speak eloquently, [so carefully] to dispose their Speech, [as even] to [observe] a <hi>Decorum</hi> [in the very Composition] of their Mouth and Hands; and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place [to forbid] the taking Care of Defects and Absurdities, and the being asham'd even of committing Solecisms, is the Property of a Man, who [little cares, what he says, but rashly] utters, whatever comes [first] into [his Mouth.]</p>
               <p>Moreover in his <hi>[Natural Positions]</hi> having warn'd us [not to trouble our selves, but] to be at quiet about such things, as require Experience and History, he says; <hi>Let us not think after the same manner with</hi> Plato, <hi>that liquid Nourishment is convey'd to the Lungs, and dry to the Stomach, nor let us embrace other Errors, like to these.</hi> Now 'tis my Opinion, that to reprehend others, and then not to keep ones self from falling into those things, which one has reprehended, is the greatest of Contradictions, and shamefulest of Errors. But he says, that the Connexions, [made] by the ten [principal] Axioms, amount to above a Million in Number, having neither search'd diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into it by himself, nor attain'd to the Truth by Men experienc'd in it. Yet <hi>Plato</hi> had to testifie for him, the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:46327:261"/> most renowned of the Physicians, <hi>Hippocrates, Philistian,</hi> and <hi>Dioxippus</hi> the Disciple of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, <hi>Euripides, Alcaeus, Eupolis,</hi> and <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> who [all] say, that the Drink passes through the Lungs. But all the Arithmeticians refel <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> amongst whom also is <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> demonstrating, that the Error of his Computation is very great; if indeed the Affirmative makes of the connext Axioms one hundred and three thousand forty and nine, and the Negative three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten thousand, nine hundred fifty and two.</p>
               <p>Some of the Ancients have said, that the same besel <hi>Zeno,</hi> which befals him, who has sowr Wine, which he can sell neither for Vinegar nor Wine; for his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,</hi> as he call'd it, cannot be dispos'd of, either as good, or indifferent. But <hi>Chrysippus</hi> has made the Matter yet far more intricate, for he sometimes says, that they are mad, who make no account of Riches, Health, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Pain, and Integrity of the Body, nor take any Care to attain them, and having cited that Sentence of <hi>Hesiod,</hi>
                  <q>Work hard, O God born <hi>Perses—</hi>
                  </q> He crys out, that 'twould be a madness to advise the contrary, and say,
<q>Work not, O God-born <hi>Perses—</hi>
                  </q> And in his Book <hi>Of Lives</hi> he affirms, that a wise Man will for the sake of Gain live with Kings, and teach for Money, receiving from some of his Scholars his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward before hand, and making Contracts with others of them; and in his seventh Book <hi>Of Duties</hi> he says, that he will [not scruple to] turn his Heels thrice over his Head, if for so doing he may have a Talent. In his first Book <hi>Of Good Things,</hi> he yields and grants to those
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:46327:261"/> that desire it, to call these <hi>Precedents</hi> Good, and their Contraries Evil, in these very Words: <hi>If any one will, according to these Permutations, call one thing good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and another evil, having a regard to these things, and not wandring elsewhere, nor failing in the Ʋnderstanding of the things signify'd, let him in the rest accommodate himself <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Custom for the Denominations.</hi> Having thus in this place set his <hi>Precedent</hi> so near, and mixt it with Good, he again says, that none of these things belongs at all to us, but that Reason withdraws and averts us from all such things: for he has written thus in his first Book <hi>Of Exhortations.</hi> And in his third Book <hi>Of Nature</hi> he says, that some esteem those happy, who reign, and are rich: which is all one, as if those should be reputed happy, who make Water in golden Chamber-pots, and wear golden Fringes. But to a good Man, the Losing of his whole Estate is but as the losing of one Groat, and the being sick no more, than if he had stumbled. Wherefore he has not fill'd Vertue only, but Providence also, with these Contradictions. For Vertue would seem to the utmost degree sordid and foolish, if it should busie it self about such Matters, and enjoyn a wise Man for their sake to sail to <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> or tumble with his Heels over his Head. And <hi>Jupiter</hi> would be very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to be stil'd <hi>Ctesius, Epicarpius,</hi> and <hi>Charidotes:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause forsooth he gives the Wicked golden Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, and golden Fringes, and the Good such things, as are hardly worth a Groat, when through <hi>Jupiters</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence they become rich. And yet much more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous is <hi>Apollo,</hi> if he sits to give Oracles concerning golden Fringes And Chamber-pots, and the recovering of a Stumble. But they make this Repugnancy yet more evident by their Demonstration: For they say, that what may be us'd both well and ill, the same is neither good nor bad: But Fools make an Ill use of Riches, Health, and Strength of Body: therefore none
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:46327:262"/> of these is good. If therefore God gives not Vertue to Men, but Honesty is eligible of it self, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows on them Riches and Health without Vertue, he confers them not on those, who will use them well, but ill, that is, hurtfully, shamefully and perniciously. Now, if the Gods indeed can bestow Vertue, and do not, they are not good; but if they cannot make Men good, neither can they help them. Now [to say,] that the Gods judge those, who are otherwise made good, according to Vertue and Strength, is nothing [to the purpose:] for good Men also judge evil ones ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Vertue and Strength: so that they do no more aid Men, than they are aided by them.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Chrysippus</hi> neither professes himself to be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor any one of his Disciples and Teachers. What then do they think of others, but those things which they say: That they are mad, Fools, impious, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors of the Laws, and in the utmost degree of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and Unhappiness? And yet they say, that our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, though we act thus miserably, are govern'd by the Providence of the Gods. Now if the Gods, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [their Mind,] should desire to hurt, afflict, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and quite crush us, they could not put us in a worse Condition, than we already are, as <hi>Chrysippus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates, that Life can neither admit an Excess of Misery, nor unhappiness: so that if it had a Voice, it would pronounce these Words of <hi>Hercules:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>I am so full of Miseries, there is</l>
                     <l>No Place to stow them in—</l>
                  </q> Now who can imagine any Assertion more repugnant to one another; than that of <hi>Chrysippus</hi> concerning the Gods, and that concerning Men; when he says, that the Gods do in the best manner possible provide for Men; and yet Men are in the worst Condition imaginable?</p>
               <pb n="505" facs="tcp:46327:262"/>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> blame him for having in his Book <hi>Of Justice</hi> written concerning Cocks, that they are usefully procreated, because they awaken us from our Sleep, hunt out Scorpions, and animate us to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, breeding in us a certain Emulation to shew Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and yet that we must eat them, lest the Number of Chickens should be greater, than were expedient. But he so derides those, who blame him for this, that he has written thus concerning <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Saviour, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Father of Justice, Equity and Peace, in his third Book <hi>Of the Gods. As Cities, overcharg'd [with too great a Number of Citizens,] send forth Colonies into other Places, and make war upon some: so does God give the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Corruption.</hi> And he brings in <hi>Euripides</hi> for a Witness with others, who say, that the <hi>Trojan</hi> War was caus'd by the Gods, to exhaust the Multitude of Men.</p>
               <p>But letting pass their other Absurdities, (for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is not to enquire, what they have said amiss, but only what they have said dissonantly to themselves:) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how he always attributes to the Gods specious and kind Appellations; but at the same time cruel, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and <hi>Galatian</hi> Deeds. For those so great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Carnages, as were the Productions of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> War, and again of the <hi>Median</hi> and <hi>Peloponnesian,</hi> were no way like to Colonies, unless these Men know of some Cities, built in Hell, and under the Earth. But <hi>Chrysippus</hi> makes God like to <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> the <hi>Galatian</hi> King, who having many Sons, and being desirous to leave his Kingdom and House to one of them, kill'd all the rest: as he that cuts and prunes away all the other Branches from the Vine, that one, which he leaves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, may grow strong and great; but the Vine-dresser does this, the Sprig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>However this is but a small matter; but that, [which follows,] is greater. For there is no War amongst Men without Vice. But sometimes [Luxury, or] the Love of Pleasure, sometimes [Avarice, or] or the Love of Money, and sometimes [Ambition, or] the Love of Glory and Rule is the Cause of it. If therefore God is the Author of Wars, [he must be] also of Sins, provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perverting Men. And yet himself says in his Treatise <hi>Of Judgment,</hi> and his second Book <hi>Of the Gods,</hi> that 'tis no way rational to say, that the Divinity is in any respect the Cause of Dishonesty. For as the Law can no way be the Cause of transgressing: so neither can the Gods of being impious: therefore neither is it rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, that they should be the Causes of any thing that is filthy. What therefore can be more filthy to Men, than the mutual Killing of one another; to which <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus</hi> says, that God gives Beginnings.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to one another. Yet that very thing, which is now prais'd, may be objected, not once,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:46327:263"/> or twice, or thrice, but even ten thousand times against <hi>Chrysippus:</hi>
                  <q>'Tis a most easie thing t'accuse the Gods.</q> For first having in his Book <hi>Of Nature</hi> compar'd the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of Motion to a Drink, made of divers Species, confusedly mixt together, turning and jumbling the things, that are made, some this way, others that way, he goes on thus: <hi>Now the Administration of the Ʋniverse proceeding in this manner, 'tis of Necessity, we should be in the Condition we are, whether contrary to our own Nature we are sick, or maim'd, or whether we are Grammarians, or Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And again a little after: <hi>According to this Reason, we shall say the like of our Virtue and Vice, and generally of Arts, or the Ignorance of Arts, as I have said.</hi> And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, taking away all Ambiguity, [he says:] <hi>For no particular thing, not even the least, can be otherwise, than according to common Nature, and its Reason.</hi> But that common Nature, and the common Reason of Nature is [with him] Fate, and Providence, and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> is not unknown even to the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> For these things are every where inculcated by them; and he affirms, that <hi>Homer</hi> said very well,
<q>—The Will of <hi>Jove</hi> was done,</q> Having Respect to Fate, and the Nature of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. How then do these things agree, both that God is no way the Cause of any dishonest thing; and again that not even the least thing [imaginable] can be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise done, than according to common Nature and its Reason? For amongst all things, that are done, there must of necessity be also dishonest things. And though <hi>Epicurus</hi> indeed turns himself every way, and studies Artifices, devising how to deliver, and set loose our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:46327:264"/> Free Will from this eternal Motion, that he may not leave Vice irreprehensible; [yet <hi>Chrysippus</hi>] gives, it [to wit Vice,] a most absolute Liberty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, not only of Necessity, or according to Fate, but also according to the Reason of God, and best Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And these things are yet farther seen, being thus Word for Word: <hi>For common Nature extending to all things, it will be of necessity that every thing, howsoever done in reason, and in whatsoever of its Parts, must be done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this [common Nature,] and the Reason of this, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on without any Impediment. For there is nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that can hinder the Administration, nor is there any of the Parts, that can be mov'd, or habituated otherwise, than according to common Nature.</hi> What then are these Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Motions of the Parts? 'Tis Manifest, that the Habits are Vices and Diseases, Covetousness, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Ambition, Cowardise, Injustice: and that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Adulteries, Thefts, Treasons, Murders, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides. Of these <hi>Chrysippus</hi> thinks, that no one, either little or great, is contrary to the Reason of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Law, Justice and Providence: so that neither the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing of the Law is done against the Law, nor the acting injustly against Justice, nor the committing of Sin against Providence. And yet he says, that God punishes Vice, and does many things for the chastizing of the Wicked. As in his second Book <hi>Of the Gods</hi> he says, that many Adversities sometimes befal the Good, not, as they do the Wicked, for Punishment, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to another Dispensation, as it is in Cities. And again in these Words: <hi>First we are to understand of Evils in like manner, as has been said before; then, that these things are distributed according to the Reason of</hi> Jupiter, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Punishment, or according to some other Dispensation, having in some sort [Respect] to the Ʋniverse.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is indeed severe, that Wickedness is both done, and punisht according to the Reason of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But he
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:46327:264"/> aggravates this Contradiction in his second Book <hi>Of Nature,</hi> writing thus: <hi>Vice, in reference to grievous Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents has a certain Reason of its own. For 'tis also in some sort according to the Reason of Nature, and, as I may so say, is not wholly useless in respect of the Ʋniverse: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise also there would not be any Good.</hi> Thus does he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend those, that dispute indifferently on both sides, who out of a Desire to say something wholly singular, and more exquisite concerning every thing, affirms, that [Men] do not unprofitably cut Purses, calumniate, and play the Madmen, and that 'tis not unprofitable, there should be unprofitable, hurtful, and unhappy [Persons.] What manner [of God] then is <hi>Jupiter,</hi> I mean <hi>Chrysippus</hi>'s <hi>[Jupiter,]</hi> who punishes an Act, neither done willingly, nor unprofitably. For Vice is indeed according to <hi>Chrysippus</hi>'s Discourse, wholly irreprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but <hi>Jupiter</hi> is to be blam'd, whether he has made Vice, being an unprofitable thing, or having made it not unprofitably, punishes it. Again in his first Book <hi>Of Justice,</hi> having spoken of the Gods, as resisting tho Injustices of some, he says, <hi>But wholly to take away Vice, is neither possible nor expedient.</hi> [Whether it were not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,] that Law-breaking, Injustice, and Folly, should be taken away, 'tis not the Design of this present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to enquire. But he himself, as much as in him lies, by his Philosophy taking away Vice, which 'tis not expedient to take away, does something repugnant both to Reason, and God. Besides this, saying, that God resists some Injustices, he again insinuates the Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Sins.</p>
               <p>Having often written, that there is nothing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, nothing to be complain'd of in the World, all things being finisht according to a most excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; he again elsewhere leaves certain Negligences to be reprehended, and those not concerning small or base Matters. For having in his third Book <hi>Of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
                  <pb n="510" facs="tcp:46327:265"/> related, that some such things befal honest and good Men, he says: <hi>Whether it be, that some things are not regarded, as in great Families some Bran, yea, and some Grains of Corn also are scatter'd, the Generality being [ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless] well order'd; or whether there are [any] evil</hi> Genii <hi>set over such things, in which indeed there are faulty Negligences:</hi> and he also affirms, that there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> much Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity intermixt. I let pass, how inconsiderate it is, to compare such Accidents, befalling honest and good Men, as were the Condemnation of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the Burning of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whilst he was yet living, by the <hi>Cyloneans,</hi> the putting to Death, and that with Torture, of <hi>Zeno</hi> by the Tyrant <hi>Demulus;</hi> and of <hi>Antiphon</hi> by <hi>Dionysius,</hi> with the letting fall of Bran. But that there should be evil <hi>Genii</hi> plac'd by Providence over such Charges; how can it but be a Reproach to God, as [it would] to a King to commit the [Administration of his] Provinces to evil and rash Governours and Captains, and suffer the best [of his Subjects] to be despis'd and ill treated by them? And furthermore, if there is much Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mixt amongst Affairs, then God has not Power over them all, nor are they all administred according to his Reason.</p>
               <p>He contends much against <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and those, that take away Providence from the Conceptions, we have of the Gods, whom we esteem beneficial and gracious to Men. And these things being frequently said by them, there is no necessity of setting down the Words. Yet all do not conceive the Gods to be good [and favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,] to us. For see what the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Syrians</hi> think of the Gods; look also into the Poems, with how much Superstition they are fill'd. But there is not any one in a manner to speak of, that imagins God to be corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or have been born. And to omit all others, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi> the <hi>Tarsian,</hi> in his Book <hi>Of the Gods,</hi> writes thus word for word: <hi>But to render all the Discourse perspicuous,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:46327:265"/> we will briefly repeat the Opinion, we have concerning God. We understand therefore God to be an Animal, blessed, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and beneficial to Men.</hi> And then expounding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of these [Terms,] he says: <hi>And indeed all esteem the Gods to be incorruptible. Chrysippus</hi> therefore is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Antipater,</hi> none of all: for he thinks none of the Gods, except <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to be incorruptible; but that they all were equally born, and shall dy. These things are in a manner every where said by him. But I will set down his Words out of his third Book <hi>Of the Gods,</hi> according to another Discourse. <hi>For some of them are born and corruptible; but others not born. And to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate these things from the beginning, will be more fit for a Treatise of Nature. For the Sun, the Moon, and other Gods, who are of like Nature, were begotten; but</hi> Jupiter <hi>is eternal.</hi> And again going on: <hi>But the like will be said concerning dying and being born, both concerning the other Gods, and</hi> Jupiter. <hi>For they indeed are corruptible, but his Parts incorruptible.</hi> With these I will compare a few of the things said by <hi>Antipater. Whosoever they are, that shall take away from the Gods Beneficence, they touch but in part the Prenotion of them, and according to the same Reason, they also, who think, they participate of Generation and Corruption.</hi> If then he, who esteems the Gods corruptible, is equally absurd with him, who thinks them not to be provident and gracious to Men, <hi>Chrysippus</hi> is no less in an Error than <hi>Epicurus.</hi> For one of them deprives the Gods of Beneficence, the other of Incorruptibility.</p>
               <p>And moreover, <hi>Chrysippus</hi> in his third Book <hi>Of the Gods,</hi> [treating] of the other Gods being nourish'd, says thus: <hi>The other Gods indeed use Nourishment, being equally sustain'd by it; but</hi> Jupiter <hi>and the World after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner than those, who are consum'd, and were engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by Fire.</hi> Here indeed he declares, that all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods are nourish'd, except the World, and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter;</hi> but in his first Book <hi>Of Providence</hi> he says, that
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:46327:266"/>
                  <hi>Jupiter</hi> increases, till he has consum'd all things into himself. <hi>For since Death is the Separation of the Soul from the Body, and the Soul of the World is not indeed separated, but increases continually, till it has consum'd all Matter into it self, 'tis not to be said, that the World dies.</hi> Who therefore can appear to speak things more contradictory to himself, than he, who says, that the same God [is nourish'd, and not nourish'd?] Nor is there any need of gathering this by Argument: for himself has plainly written in the same place: <hi>But the World alone is said to be self-sufficient, because it alone has in it self all things, it stands in need of, and is nourish'd, and augmented of it self, the other Parts being mutually chang'd into one another.</hi> He is then repugnant to himself, not only by declaring in one Place, that all the Gods are nourish'd, except the World, and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and saying in another, that the World also is nourisht; but much more, when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that the World increases by nourishing it self: Now the contrary had been [much more] probable, [to wit] that the World alone does not increase, having its own Destruction for its Food; but that Addition and Increase are Incident to the other Gods, who are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd from without, and that the World is rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd into them, if so it is, that the World feeds on it self, and they always receive something, and are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd from that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Conception of the Gods contains in it Felicity, Blessedness, and Self-perfection. Wherefore also <hi>Euripides</hi> is commended for saying:
<q>
                     <l>For God, If truly God, does nothing want</l>
                     <l>Of these: and all their Speeches are but Cant.</l>
                  </q> But <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> in the Places, I have alledg'd, says, that the World only is self-sufficient, because this alone has in it self all things, it needs. What then follows from
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:46327:266"/> this, that the World alone is self-sufficient? That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sun, Moon, nor any other of the Gods, is self-sufficient, and not being self-sufficient, they are not happy, or blessed.</p>
               <p>He says, that the Infant in the Womb is nourish'd by Nature, like a Plant; but when it is brought forth, being cool'd and hardned by the Air, it changes its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and becomes an Animal: whence the Soul is not unfitly nam'd <hi>Psyche,</hi> because of this Refrigeration. But again, he esteems the Soul the more subtil and fine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nature, therein contradicting himself: for how can a subtil thing be made of a gross one, and be rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by Refrigeration and Condensation? And what is more, how does he, declaring an Animal to be made by Refrigeration, think the Sun to be animated, which is of Fire, and made of an Exhalation, chang'd into Fire? For he says in his third Book <hi>Of Nature: Now the Change of Fire is such: It is turn'd by the Air into Water: and the Earth subsisting of this, the Air exhales: the Air being subtiliz'd, the</hi> Aether <hi>[or Fire] is produc'd round about it: and the Stars are with the Sun kindled from the Sea.</hi> Now what is more contrary to Kindling than Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or to Rarefaction than Condensation? [of which] the one makes Water and Earth of Fire and Air, and the other changes that, which is moist and earthy, into Fire and Air. But yet in one place he makes Kindling, in another Cooling to be the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Animation. And he moreover says, that, when the Inflammation is throughout, it lives and is an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; but being again extinct and thickned, it is turn'd into Water, and Earth, and Corporeity. Now in his first Book <hi>Of Providence,</hi> he says: <hi>For the World indeed, being wholly set on fire, is presently also the Soul and Guide of it self: but when being chang'd into Moisture, and the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining within it, it in some sort passes with that into a Body and Soul so as to consist of them, it is then after anot er manner:</hi>
                  <pb n="514" facs="tcp:46327:267"/> Here forsooth he plainly says, that the inanimate parts of the World are by Inflammation turn'd into an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated thing; and that again by Extinction the Soul is relax'd and moistned, being chang'd into Corporeity. He seems therefore very absurd, one while by Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration making Animals of sensele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> things; and again, by the same changing the greatest part of the Worlds Soul into senseless and inanimate things.</p>
               <p>But besides this, his Discourse concerning the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Soul, has a Demonstration contrary to his own Opinion: for he says, that the Soul is generated, when the Infant is already brought forth, the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chang'd by Refrigeration, as by Hardning. Now for the Souls being engendred, and that after the Birth, he, chiefly uses this Demonstration, that the Children are for the most part in manners and Inclination like to their Parents. Now the Repugnancy of these things is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For 'tis not possible, that the Soul, which is [not] generated [till] after the Birth, should have its Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the Birth; or it will fall out, that the Soul is like, before it is generated; that is, it will both be in likeness, and yet not be, because it is not yet generated. But if any one says, that, the Likeness being bred in the Tempers of the Bodies, the Souls are chang'd, when they are generated, he destroys the Argument of the Souls being generated. For thus it may come to pass, that the Soul, though not generated, may at its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance [into the Body] be chang'd by the Mixture of Likeness.</p>
               <p>He says sometimes, that the Air is light, and mounts upwards, and sometimes, that 'tis neither heavy nor light. For in his second Book <hi>Of Motion,</hi> he says, that the Fire, being without Gravity, ascends upwards, and the Air like to that; the Water approaching more to the Earth, and the Air to the Fire. But in his <hi>Physical Arts,</hi> he inclines to the other Opinion, that the Air of
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:46327:267"/> it self has neither Gravity nor Levity. He says, that the Air is by Nature Dark, and uses this as an Argument of its being also the first Cold: for that its Darkness is opposite to the Brightness, and its Coldness to the Heat of Fire. Moving this in his Book <hi>Of Natural Questions,</hi> he again in his Treatise <hi>Of Habits</hi> says, that Habits are nothing else but Airs. For Bodies are contain'd by these, and the Cause, that every one of the Bodies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in [any] Habit, is such [as it is,] is the contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Air, which they call in Iron Hardness, in Stone Solidness, in Silver Whiteness: these [Words] having [in them] much Absurdity and Contradiction. For if the Air remains such, as it is of its own Nature, how comes Black in that, which is not White, to be made Whiteness, and Soft in that, which is not Hard, to be made Hardness: and Rare in that, which is not thick, to be made Thickness? But if b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ng mixt with these, it is alter'd and made like to them, how is it an Habit or Cause of these things, by which it is subdu'd? For such a Change, by which it loses its own Qualities, is [the Property] of a Patient, not of an Agent, and not of a thing containing, but languishing. Yet they every where affirm, that Matter, being of its own Nature idle and motionless, is subjected to Qualities, and that the Qualities are Spirits; which, being also aëreal Tensions, give a Form and Figure to every Part of Matter, to which they adhere. These things they cannot [ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally] say, supposing the Air to be such, as they affirm it. For if it is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>bit and Tension, it will assimilate every Body to it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, so that it shall be black and soft. But if by the Mixture with these things it receives Forms contrary to those, it has, it will be in some sort the Matter, and not the Cause or Power of Matter.</p>
               <p>It is often said by <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> that there is without the World an infinite <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and that this Infinity has
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:46327:268"/> neither Beginning, Middle, nor End. And by this the <hi>Stoicks</hi> chiefly refute that spontaneous Motion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms downward, which is taught by <hi>Epicurus,</hi> there not being in Infinity any Difference, according to which, one thing is thought to be above, another below. But in his fourth Book <hi>Of things possible,</hi> having suppos'd a certain middle Place, and middle Region, he says, that the World is situated there. The Words are these: <hi>Wherefore 'tis to be said of the World, that it is incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; which though it seems to want Proof, yet nevertheless it rather appears to me to be so. However the Comprehension of Place cooperates very much towards its Incorruptibility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is [seated] in the Midst: since if it were thought to be any where else, Corruption would absolutely take hold of it.</hi> And again a little after: <hi>For so also in a manner has Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence hapned eternally to have possess'd the middle Place, being immediately [from the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>inning] such [as it is] so that both by another manner, and through this Chance, it admits not any Corruption, [and] is therefore eternal.</hi> These Words have one apparent and visible Contradiction, [to wit] his admitting a certain middle Place and middle Region in Infinity: [They have also] a second, more obscure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but [withal] more absurd than this. For think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the World would not have remain'd incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, if its Situation had hapned to have been in any other part of the <hi>Vacuum,</hi> he manifestly appears to have fear'd, lest, the Parts of Essence moving towards the Middle, there should be a Dissolution and Corruption of the World. Now this he wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> not have fear'd, had he not thought, that Bodies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> by Nature tend from every Place towards the Middle, not of Essence, but of the Region containing Essence: Of which also he has frequently spoken, as of a thing impossible, and that is contrary to Nature: for that there is not in the <hi>Vacuum</hi> any Difference, by which Bodies are drawn ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this way than that way; but that the Construction
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:46327:268"/> of the World is the Cause of Motion, [Bodies] inclining and being carry'd from every side to the Center and Middle of it. 'Tis sufficient for this Purpose, to set down the Text out of his second Book <hi>Of Motion:</hi> For having discours'd, that the World indeed is a perfect Body, but that the Parts of the World are not perfect, because they have in some sort respect to the whole, and are not of themselves: and going forward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its Motion, as having been fram'd by Nature to be mov'd by all its Parts to its Compaction and Cohaesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not to its Dissolution and Breaking, he says thus: <hi>But the Ʋniverse thus tending and being mov'd to the same Point, and the Parts having the same Motion from the Nature of the Body, 'tis probable, that all Bodies have this first Motion according to Nature, towards the Middle of the World, the World being thus mov'd towards it self, and the Parts, as being Parts.</hi> What then ail'd you, good Sir, (might some one say to him) that you have so far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten these Words, as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffirm, that the World, if it had not casually possest the middle Place, would have been dissoluble and corruptible. For if it is by Nature so fram'd, as always to incline towards the Middle, and its Parts from every side tend to the same, into what Place soever of the <hi>Vacuum</hi> it should have been trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, thus containing, and [as it were] embracing it self, it would have remain'd incorruptible, and without danger of breaking. For things, that are broken and dissipated, suffer this by the Separation and Dissolution of their Parts, every one [of them] hasting to its own Place from that, which it had contrary to Nature. But you, being of Opinion, that, if the World should have been seated in any other Place of the <hi>Vacuum,</hi> it would have been wholly liable to Corruption, and affirming the same, and therefore [asserting] a Middle in that, which naturally ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For what is more principal than the Permanency of the World, or that its Essence, united in its Parts, is contain'd in it self? But this, as <hi>Chrysippus</hi> says, fell out casually. For if the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of Place is the Cause of Incorruptibility, and this was the Production of Chance, 'tis manifest, that the Preservation of the Universe is a Work of Chance, and not of Fate and Providence.</p>
               <p>Now as for his Doctrine of Possibles, how can it but be repugnant to his Doctrine of Fate? For if that is not possible, which either is true, or shall be true, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> has it; but every thing which is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though it never shall be, is possible: there will be many of those things possible, which will never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:46327:269"/> to invincible, inviolable, and all-conquering Fate. [And] either Fate will lose its Power, or if that, as <hi>Chrysippus</hi> thinks, has Existence, that, which is susceptible of Being, will often fall out to be impossible. And every thing, indeed which is true, will be necessary, being comprehended by the Principal of all Necessities; and every thing that is false, will be impossible, having the greatest Cause to oppose its ever being true. For how is it possible, that he should be susceptible of dying on the Land, who is destinated to dye at Sea? and how is it possible for him, who is at <hi>Megara,</hi> to come to <hi>Athens,</hi> being prohibited by Fate?</p>
               <p>But moreover, the things that are boldly asserted by him concerning Fantasies [or Imaginations;] are very opposite to Fate. For desiring to shew, that Fantasie is not of it self a perfect cause of Consent, he said, that the Sages [or wise Men] will prejudice us by imprinting false Imaginations [in our Minds,] if Fantasies do of themselves absolutely cause Consents: for wise Men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten make use of Falsity against the Wicked, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a probable Imagination, yet not the Cause of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: for then it would be also a Cause of false Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and Error. Any one therefore, transferring these things from the wise Man to Fate, may say, that Consents are not caus'd by Fate: for [if they were] false Consents, and Opinions, and Deceptions would also be [by Fate,] and Men would be endammag'd by Fate. Thus the Reason, which exempts the wise Man from doing hurt, at the same time also demonstrates, that Fate is not the Cause of all things. For if Men neither opine, nor are prejudic'd by Fate, 'tis manifest [also,] that they neither act rightly, nor are wise, nor remain firm in their Sentiments, nor have Utility by Fate; but that there is an End of Fate's being the Cause of all things. Now if any one shall say, that <hi>Chrysippus</hi> makes not Fate the absolute Cause of all things, but only a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catarctical
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:46327:270"/>
[or antecedent] one, he will again shew, that he is contradictory to himself, since he excessively praises <hi>Homer</hi> for saying of <hi>Jupiter:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Receive, whatever Good or Evil He</l>
                     <l>Shall send to each of you—</l>
                  </q> As also <hi>Euripides</hi> [for these Words:]
<q>
                     <l>O <hi>Jove,</hi> how can I say, that wretched we</l>
                     <l>Poor Mortals understand ought? For on thee</l>
                     <l>We all depend, and nothing can transact,</l>
                     <l>But as thy sacred Wisdom shall enact.</l>
                  </q> And himself writes many things agreeable to these. In fine, he says, that nothing, be it never so little, either rests, or is mov'd, otherwise than according to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which is the same thing with Fate. Moreover, the Catarctick [antecedent, or principiating] Cause is weaker than the absolute one, and attains not [to its effect,] being subdu'd by others, that rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. But he himself, declaring Fate to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, unimpeachable, and inflexible Cause, calls it<note n="*" place="margin">That i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then shall we say, that neither Consents, nor Vertues, nor Vices, nor doing well, nor doing ill, are in us, [or in our Power?] or shall we affirm, that Fate is deficient, that terminating Destiny is unable to determine, and that the Motions and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of <hi>Jupiter</hi> [and his Reason] are unaccomplish'd? For the one of these [two Consequences] will follow from Fates being an absolute, the other from its being only a procatarctick Cause. For if it is an absolute Cause, it takes away our Free Will, and what is in us;
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:46327:270"/> and if it is [only] procatarctick, it loses its being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impeachable and effectual. For not once, or ten times, but every where, especially in his <hi>Physicks,</hi> he has written, that there are many Obstacles and Impediments to particular Natures and Motions, but none to that of the Universe.

For neither can the Nature of Man be free from Impediment, if that of the Foot or Hand is not so; nor can the Motion of a Ship but be hindred, if there are any Obstacles about the Sails, or the Operation of the Oars. Besides [all] this, if the Fantasies are not according to Fate, [<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Since, they say, that those, who adhere to one of them, and withhold not their Consent, do amiss: for if they yield to obscure things, they stumble; if to false, they are deceiv'd; if to such as are not commonly comprehended, they opine. And yet one of these three is of necessity, either that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Fantasie is not the Work of Fate, or that every Receit and Consent of Fantasie is faultless, or that Fate it self is not irreprehensible. For I do not know how it can be blameless, proposing to us such Fantasies, that not the resisting, or going against them, but the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and yielding to them is blameable. Moreover, both <hi>Chrysippus</hi> and <hi>Antipater,</hi> in their Disputes against the <hi>Aca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>micks,</hi> take not a little pains to prove, that we neither act, nor are incited without Consent, saying, that, they [build on] Fictions, and false Suppositions, who think, that, a proper Fantasie being presented, we are presently incited, without having either yielded, or
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:46327:271"/> consented. Again <hi>Chrysippus</hi> says, that God imprints in us false Imaginations, as does also the wise Man, not that they would have us consent, or yield to them, but only that we should act, and be incited to that, which appears; but that we, being evil, do through Infirmity consent to such Fantasies. Now the Perplexity and Discrepancy of these Discourses from themselves is not very difficult to be discern'd. For he, that would not have Men consent, but only act, whether it be God, or a wise Man, knows that the Fantasies are sufficient for acting, and that Consents are superfluous. So that if Knowing, that the Imagination gives us not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct to work without Consent, he ministers to us false and probable Fantasies, he is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>
                     <l>I'm poor, you rich, I'l therefore nothing give,</l>
                     <l>Lest me, or Fool, or Beggar, you believe.</l>
                  </q> For he, who out of his little Estate makes small Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to those, that have great Possessions, does them no Pleasure, nay, [which is yet worse,] being not believ'd to give [even that little <hi>gratis,</hi> or] for nothing, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs the Suspition of being of a sordid and ungenerous Disposition. But since pecuniary Presents are both in Bounty and Beauty far inferior to such, as proceed from Learning and Wisdom, 'tis honorable both to make such Presents, and at our giving them, to desire suitable Returns from the Receivers. I therefore, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, and for your Sake, to our Friends in those
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:46327:272"/> Parts, as a First-fruit Offering, some Discourses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Pythian</hi> Affairs, confess, that I do [in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal] expect others, both more, and better from you, as being [Persons] conversant in a great City, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Leisure amongst many Books and Conferences of all sorts. For indeed our good <hi>Apollo</hi> seems to cure and solve such Difficulties, as occur in [the ordinary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of our] Life, by giving his Oracles to those that resort to him; but as for those, which concern Learning, he leaves and proposes them to that Faculty of the Soul, which is naturally addicted to the Study of Philosophy, imprinting in it a Desire leading to Truth; as is manifest both in many other Matters, and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of [this Inscription] <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For 'tis not probable, that 'twas either by chance, or by a Lottery (as it were) of Letters, that this [Word] alone was by the God, plac'd in the principal Seat, and receiv'd the Dignity of a sacred Donary and Spectacle; but ['tis highly credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble] that those, who at the beginning philosophiz'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this God, gave it that Station, either as seeing in it some peculiar and extraordinary Power, or using it as a Symbol, to [signifie] some other thing, worthy of [our] Attention.</p>
               <p>Having therefore often formerly declin'd and avoided this Discourse, when propos'd in the School, I was lately surpriz'd by my own Children, as I was debating with certain Strangers, who being on their Departure out of <hi>Delphi,</hi> I could not in Civility hold them in suspence, nor yet refuse discoursing with them, since they were exceeding earnest to hear something. Being therefore sate down by the Temple, I began my self to search into some things, and to ask them concerning others, [being] by the Place, and the very Talk, [we had, put in mind of those things] we had heretofore at such time, as <hi>Nero</hi> pass'd through these Parts, heard <hi>Ammonius</hi> and some others Discourse, the same Difficulty having been
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:46327:272"/>
[then] likewise in this very place propounded. Because therefore this God is no less a Philosopher than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Ammonius</hi> seem'd to all [of us,] rightly to have apply'd every one of his Names to this purpose, and to have taught [us,] that he is <hi>Pythius,</hi> [or a Questionist,] to those, who begin to learn and enquire; <hi>Delius</hi> and <hi>Phanaeus,</hi> or a Manifester and Approver] to those, to whom somewhat of the Truth is already manifested and shines forth; <hi>Ismenius</hi> [or Knowing,] to those, that have acquir'd Knowledge and a Readiness of Speech; and <hi>Horius</hi> [or a Finisher] when they practice and enjoy [their Science,] making use [of it] to discourse and philosophize with one another. Now forasmuch as to Pholosophize, implies to Enquire, to Wonder and to Doubt; 'tis probable, that many of the things, that concern this God, are not unfitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd under Aenigms, [or mystical Speeches and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and [therefore] require [one should ask] the Reason why, and [seek] to be instructed in the Cause: as, Why of all Wood, Fir only is burnt in the eternal Fire: Why the Lawrel only is us'd in Fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Why there are erected but two [Statues of the] <hi>Parca,</hi> [or fatal Sisters,] they being every where [else] thought to be three: Why no Woman is permitted to have Access to the Curtain: What is the Reason of the <hi>Tripus</hi> [or three-footed Chair,] and other such like things, which being proposed to those, who are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together irrational and Soul-less, allure, and inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

And <hi>Ammonius</hi> bidding him speak, and defend it, [as well as he could,] he said: <q>Now that this God is a most expert Logician, many of his Oracles shew: for 'tis, to wit, the Part of the same [Artist] to dissolve and frame Ambiguities. Moreover, as <hi>Plato</hi> said, when an Oracle was given [to the <hi>Greeks,</hi>] that they should double the Altar in <hi>Delos,</hi> which is a Work of the utmost Perfection in Geometry, that the God did not order [or intend] the doing of that very thing, but commanded the <hi>Greeks</hi> to apply themselves to Geometry: so the same God, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ambiguous Oracles, honor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="529" facs="tcp:46327:274"/> as necessary to those, who desire to understand him aright. Now this Conjunction [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <hi>If,</hi>] so fit for the Connexion of a Speech, has very great Efficacy in Logick, as forming the most rational Proposition. For how can it be otherwise, since the very Brutes have indeed the Knowledge of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of things; but to Man only has Nature given the Consideration and Judgment of Consequence. For that there is both Day and Light, Wolves, and Dogs, and Birds are sensible. But that if it is Day, there must be Light, no other Animal understands, but Man, who only has the Conception of Antecedent and Consequent, of the Coherence and Connexion of these things with one another, and of their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Difference, from which things Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions take their principal Beginning. Now since Philosophy is conversant about Truth, since the Light of Truth is Demonstration, and the Beginning of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration this [Coherence and] Connexion [of Propositions,] the Faculty, which contains and effects this, was by wise Men with good reason consecrated to the God, who most of all loves Truth. Now the God indeed is a Prophet, and the Art of Prophesying is [a Divination] concerning the Future from things, that are present and past. For neither is the Original of any thing without a Cause, nor the Fore-knowledge of any thing without Reason. But since all things, that are done, follow, and are connext to those, that have been done, and those, that shall be done, to those, that are done, according to the Progress, proceeding from the Beginning to the End; he, who knows how to look into the Causes of this together, and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to connect them one with another, knows also, and divines,
<q>"What things now are, shall be, or e'rst have been.</q>
                     <pb n="530" facs="tcp:46327:275"/> And <hi>Homer</hi> indeed [excellently] well places first things, that are present, and afterwards what is future and past. For the Argument is according to the Vertue of the Connexion taken from the Present: Thus, <hi>If this is, That preceded:</hi> and again, <hi>If this is, That shall be.</hi> For the Knowledge of the Consequence is, as has been said, an artificial and rational thing; but Sense gives the Anticipation to Reason. Whence (though [it may seem] undecent to say it) I will not be afraid to aver this [Assertion,] that the <hi>Tripus</hi> [or Oracle] of Truth is Reason, which, joyning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of the Subsequent to the Antecedent, and then assuming the present, infers the Conclusion of the Demonstration. If then the <hi>Pythian [Apollo]</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in Musick, and [is pleas'd] with the Singing of Swans, and the Harmony of the Lute [or Harp,] what Wonder is it, that for the sake of Logick, he embraces and loves this argumentative Particle, which he sees the Philosophers so much and so frequently to use? <hi>Hercules</hi> indeed, not having yet unbound <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> nor convers'd with the Sophisters, that were with <hi>Chiron</hi> and <hi>Atlas,</hi> but being still a young Man, and a plain <hi>Boeotian,</hi> at first abolish'd Logick, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided this Word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Theon</hi> having ended [his Speech,] I think, 'twas <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophus</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who said to us: <q>Do you not see, how valiantly <hi>Theon</hi> vindicates Logick, having in a manner got on the Lions Skin, and not suffering e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, who comprehensively place all the Affairs, Natures and Principles of things, both Divine and Humane in Number, and make it most especially the
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:46327:275"/> Author and Lord of honest and estimable things, to be at quiet, but willingly to offer the First Fruits of [our] dear Mathematicks to the God, since we think that this [Letter] E does of it self neither in Power, Figure, or Expression, differ from, [or exceed] the other Letters; but that it has been preferr'd as [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] the Sign of that great Number, having an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over all things, call'd [the Quinary, or] <hi>Pemptas,</hi> from which the Sages have expres'd the Art of Numbring by the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Eustrophus</hi> spake these things to us, not in jest, but because I did at that time studiously apply my self to the Mathematicks, and perhaps also in every thing to honor that Saying, <hi>Nothing too much,</hi> as having been [conversant] in the Academy. I answer'd therefore, that <hi>Eustrophus</hi> had excellently solv'd the Difficulty by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <q>For, <hi>said I,</hi> since all Number being distributed into Even and Odd, Unity is in efficacy common to them both, for that being added to an even Number, it makes it odd, and to an odd, it makes it even, Two constituting the Beginning of the Even, and Three of the Odd: [The Number of] Five, compos'd of these two, is deservedly honour'd, as being the first [Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound] made of the first [simple] Numbers, and is call'd the Marriage for the Resemblance of the Odd with the Female, and the Even with the Male: for in the Divisions of the Numbers into equal Parts, the Even, being wholly separated, leaves a certain capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Beginning and Space in it self; but in the Odd, suffering the same thing, there always remains a Middle, of generative Distribution, by which it is more fruitful than the other, and being mixt, is always Master, never master'd. For by the Mixture of both [Even and Odd] together; there is never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd an Even [Number,] but always an Odd. But
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:46327:276"/> which is more, either of them added to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with it self, shews the Difference: for no Even, joyn'd with another Even, ever produc'd an Odd, or went forth of its proper [Nature,] being through [its] Weakness unable to generate another, and imperfect. But Odd Numbers, mixt with Odd, do, through their being every way fruitful, produce many Even ones. Time does not now permit us to set down the other Powers and Differences of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Therefore have the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> through a [certain] Resemblance, said, that Five is the Marriage first Male and [first] Female. This also is it, for which it is call'd also Nature, by the Multiplication of it self determining again into it self. For as Nature, taking a Grain of Wheat for Seed, and diffusing it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces many Forms and Species between, by which she brings her Work to an End, but at last shews again a Grain of Wheat, restoring the Beginning in the End of all: so the rest of the Numbers, when they multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves, terminating by the Increase in others, only those of Five and Six, multiply'd by themselves, bring back and reserve themselves. For six times six makes thirty six, and five times five makes twenty five. And again, Six does this once, and only after one manner, becoming of it self that four square Number; but this indeed befalls Five, both by Multiplication, and by Composition with it self, to which being added, it alternatively makes Ten, and this as far as all [Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can extend,] this Number imitating the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, [or first Cause,] which [governs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages the Universe. For as that [first Cause,] preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World by it self, does reciprocally perfect it self by the World, [as] <hi>Heraclitus</hi> says [of Fire;]
<q>"Fire turns to all things, and all things to Fire.</q>
                     <pb n="533" facs="tcp:46327:276"/> As Wares are chang'd for Gold, and Gold for Wares: so the Congress of Five with it self is fram'd by Nature to produce nothing imperfect or strange; but has limitted Changes: for it either generates it self, or Ten, that is, either [what is] proper [to it,] or [what is] perfect.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now if any one shall say, what is all this to <hi>Apollo?</hi> We will answer, [That it concerns] not <hi>[Apollo]</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but <hi>Dionysus</hi> [or <hi>Bacchus</hi>] also, who has no less to do with <hi>Delphi</hi> than <hi>Apollo</hi> himself. For we have heard the Divines, partly in Verse, partly in Prose, saying and singing, that the God, being of his own Nature incorruptible and eternal, yet through a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fatal Decree and Reason, using Changes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is sometimes by Nature kindled into a Fire, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things alike, and other whiles becoming vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in different Shapes, Passions, and Powers, as the World now is, he is nam'd by the most known of Names. But the Wiser, concealing from the Vulgar the Change into Fire, call him both <hi>Apollo,</hi> from his Uniting, and <hi>Phoebus</hi> from his Purity and Unpolluted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But [as for] the Passion and Change of his Conversion into Winds, Water, Earth, Stars, and the [various] Kinds of Plants and Animals, and of its [Order and] Disposition, [this] they obscurely propose as a certain Distraction, and [in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects] call him <hi>Dionysus</hi> [or <hi>Bacchus] Zagreus, Nyctelius,</hi> and <hi>Isodates,</hi> exhibiting and chanting forth certain Corruptions, Disparitions, Deaths, and Regenerations, [which are all Riddles,] and [aenigmatical] Fables, fit for [the vailing and mysteriously representing of] the said Mutations: to the one indeed [that is, <hi>Dionysus,</hi> or <hi>Bacchus</hi> singing] <hi>Dithyrambie</hi> Verses, full of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Change, joyn'd with a certain Wandring and Agitation backwards and forwards: for, as <hi>Aeschilus</hi> says,
<q>
                        <pb n="334" facs="tcp:46327:277"/>
                        <l>"The <hi>Dithyramb,</hi> whose Sounds are dissonant,</l>
                        <l>"'Tis fit, should wait on <hi>Bacchus—</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q> But to the other, [that is, to <hi>Apollo,</hi>] they sing the well-ordered <hi>Paean,</hi> and a discreet Song. And this [last indeed] they do both in their Sculptures, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, always make to be young, and never declining to old Age; but that [former] they represent in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Shapes and Forms. Lastly, to the one they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute Equality, Order, and unmixt Gravity; but to the other a certain Mixture of Sports, Petulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Gravity, Madness, and Inequality: surnaming him
<q>
                        <l>"<hi>Evius Bacchus,</hi> who to Rage incites</l>
                        <l>"Women on Tops of Mountains, and delights</l>
                        <l>"In frantick Worship.—</l>
                     </q>
[By which] they not unfitly touch the Property of both Changes. Now because the Time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions in these Changes is not equal, but that of the one, which they call <hi>Coros,</hi> [that is, Satiety,] lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that of the other, [nam'd] <hi>Chresmosyne,</hi> [or Want,] shorter: observing in this the Proportion, they all the rest of the Year use in their Sacrifices the <hi>Paean;</hi> but at the beginning of Winter, rousing up the <hi>Dithyramb,</hi> and laying the <hi>Paean</hi> to rest, they do for three Months invocate this God instead of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, esteeming the Restauration of the World to be the same in [proportion of] time to the Conflagration of it, as Three is to One.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But these things have [perhaps] had more than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Time spent on them. This however is evident, that they properly attribute to this God the Number of Five, saying, that it sometimes of it self produces it
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:46327:277"/> self like Fire, and other whiles the Number of Ten, like the World. But do we think, that this Number is not also concern'd with Musick, which is [of all things] most acceptable to this God? For the chiefest Operation of Harmony is, as one may say, about Symphonies [or Accords.] Now that these are five, and no more, Reason convinces [even] him, who will by his Sense [of Hearing only] without reasoning, make Trial either on Strings or Pipe-holes. For all [these Accords] take their Original in Proportions from Number: and the Proportion of [the Symphony] <hi>Diatesseron</hi> is sesquitertial, of <hi>Diapente</hi> sesquialter, of <hi>Diapason</hi> duple, of <hi>Diapason</hi> with <hi>Diapente</hi> triple, and of <hi>Disdiapason</hi> quadruple. But as for that, which transcending all Measures, the Musicians add to these, naming it <hi>Diapason</hi> with <hi>Diatessaron,</hi> 'tis not fit, we should receive it, gratifying the unreasonable Pleasure of the Ear against Proportion, which is as the Law. That I may therefore let pass the five Positions of the Tetrachords, and also the five first, whether they are to be called <hi>Tones, Tropes,</hi> or <hi>Harmonies,</hi> as which change by rising or falling either to more or less, the rest are <hi>Basses</hi> or <hi>Trebles:</hi> Whereas there are many, or rather infinite Intervals, are not five of them only used in Musick? [to wit,] <hi>Diesis, Hemitonion, Tonos, Triemitonion,</hi> and <hi>Ditonon.</hi> Nor is there any other Space, either greater, or less in the Voice, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distinguished by <hi>Bass</hi> or <hi>Treble,</hi> comes into Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Passing by many other such like things, <hi>said I,</hi> I will only produce <hi>Plato,</hi> saying, that there is but one World, but that if this were not alone, so that there were others besides it, they would be in all five, and no more. For indeed though there is but this one only World, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> is also of Opinion, yet this World is in some sort composed and assembled of five [others,] of which one indeed is of Earth, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:46327:278"/> of Water, the third of Fire, the fourth of Air, and the fifth, being Heaven, some call Light, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Sky; and some also name this same the fifth Essence, to which alone of [all] Bodies 'tis natural to be carry'd about in a Circle, not of Necessity, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise by Accident. Wherefore knowing, that of the Figures, which are in Nature, there are five most excellent and perfect, [to wit,] the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> the <hi>Cube,</hi> the <hi>Octaëdron:</hi> the <hi>Eicosaëdron,</hi> and <hi>Dodecaaedron,</hi> he has fitly accommodated each [of them] to each [of these Worlds or Bodies.] There are some also, who apply the Faculties of the Senses, being equal in Number, to these five first Bodies, seeing the Touch to be firm and earthy, and the Taste to perceive the Qualities of Savors by Moisture. Now the Air, being struck upon in the Hearing, is a Voice and Sound; and as for the other two, the Scent, which the Smell has obtain'd [for its Object,] being an Exhalation, and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by Heat, is fiery; and for the Sight, which shines by reason of its Affinity to the Sky and Light, it has from both of them a Temperature and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion equally affected. Now neither has any Animal any other Sense, or the World any other Nature simple and unmixt; but there has been made, as appears, a certain wonderful Distribution and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of five to five.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having here stopt a little, and made a small Pause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, I said: <q>What a Fault, O <hi>Eustrophus,</hi> were we like to have committed! having almost pass by <hi>Homer,</hi> as if he were not the first, that distributed the World into five Parts, who assign'd the three, which are in the midst, to three Gods, and left the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, <hi>Olympus</hi> and the Earth, of which one is the Limit of things above, the other of things below, common and undistributed. But we must, as <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> says, return to our Discourse. For those, who
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:46327:278"/> magnifie the Quaternary or Number of Four, teach not amiss, that every [solid] Body had its Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by reason of this. For since every Solid consists in Length and Breadth, having also receiv'd a Depth, and since before Length there is extant a Point, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to Unity, and Length without Breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing call'd a Line, and consisting of two, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Line towards Breadth exhibiting also the Procreation of a Superficies, compos'd of three, and the Augmentation of this Depth, added to it, going on to a Solid; 'tis manifest to every one, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternary, having carry'd on Nature hitherto, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the perfecting of a Body, and the exhibiting it double, massy, and solid, has at last left it, wanting the greatest [Accomplishment.] For that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate, is to speak sincerely, Orphan-like, unperfect, and fit for nothing at all, unless there is some Soul to use it; but the Motion or Disposition, introducing a Soul, being a Change, made by [the Number] five, adds the Consummation to Nature, and has a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so much more excellent than the Quaternary, as an Animal differs in Dignity from that, which is inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Moreover the Symmetry and Power of [this Number] Five, having obtain'd greater Force, has not permitted the animate Body to proceed to infinite sorts, but has exhibited five Species of all things that have Life: For there are Gods, <hi>Genii,</hi> and Heroes, and then after them the fourth sort is Men, and the fifth and last the irrational and brutish Animal. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if you divide the Soul it self according to [its] Nature, its first and most obscure [Part or Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty] is the Vegetative, the second the Sensitive, then the Concupiscible, after that the Irascible, and having brought on and perfected Nature in the Faculty of the Rational, it rests in this fifth, as in the Top [of all.] Now the Generation of this Number, which
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:46327:279"/> has so many and so great Faculties, is also beautiful, not that, which we have already discours'd of, being compos'd of two and three, but that, which the [first] Principle, joyn'd with the first Square has exhibited. For the Principle of all Number is Unity, and the first Square is the Quaternary: Now the Quinary is compos'd of these, as of Form and Matter, having [attain'd to] Perfection. And if 'tis right, which some hold, that Unity is also square, as being the Power of it self, and terminating in it self, the Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, being made of the two first Squares, could not have a nobler Original.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But [as for its] greatest Excellency, I fear, lest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spoken, it should press our <hi>Plato</hi> [as much,] as he himself said, <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> was by the Name of the Moon, who made a certain Opinion concerning her Illuminations, which was very ancient, [to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of] his own. For has he not said this in [his Dialogue, entitled] <hi>Cratylus?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Yes indeed, <hi>answer'd</hi> Eustrophus; but I see not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that has fallen out like it. And yet you know, that in [his Treatise, which has for its Title] <hi>The Sophister,</hi> he demonstrates five principal Beginnings, [to wit] <hi>Ens</hi> [or, <hi>That which is,] The Same, Another,</hi> adding] to these for a fourth and fifth <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Rest.</hi> Again, in [his Dialogue, call'd] <hi>Philebus,</hi> using another manner of Division, he says, that there is one thing infinite, and another the Extremity, [or End:] and that all Generation consists of these [two] mixt [together.] Then he puts the Cause, by which they are mixt, for the fourth Kind: and has left us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture the fifth, by which the things that were mixt, have again a Division and Dissipation. Now I am [altogether] of Opinion, that these [last] are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd as the Images [or Representations] of those [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wit,] <hi>The things engendred of Ens</hi> [or, <hi>That
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:46327:279"/> which is,] Infinite</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi> and the <hi>Extremity</hi> of <hi>Rest;</hi> the <hi>Mixing Principle</hi> of <hi>The same,</hi> and the <hi>Separating</hi> of <hi>The other.</hi> But if these are different [from those,] yet both that way and this way [these Principles are still distingusht] in five Kinds and Differences. Now some one, <hi>said he,</hi> being perswaded of these things, [and] seeing them before <hi>Plato,</hi> consecrated to the God two E E, for a Mark and Symbol of the Number of all things. And having perhaps further understood, that Good also appears in five Kinds, of which the first is <hi>Mean</hi> [or <hi>Measur'd,</hi>] the second <hi>Commensurate</hi> [or <hi>Proportion'd,</hi>] the third <hi>Ʋnderstanding,</hi> the fourth <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Arts,</hi> and <hi>true Opinions in the Soul,</hi> and the fifth, a certain <hi>Pleasure, pure and unmixt with Sorrow;</hi> he stops there, subjoyning that of <hi>Orpheus:</hi>

                  <q>After he had spoken these things to us, he said, Yet one short [Word] to those about <hi>Nicander,</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>It is so, <hi>said</hi> Nicander; but the Cause is not to be told to others.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Well then, <hi>said I smiling,</hi> till such time as the God admits us, being consecrated to know the Truth, this also shall be added to those things, that have been spoken concerning the Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</q>

               <p>This End, as I remember, had the Discourse of the Arithmetical and Mathematical Encomiums of E. But <hi>Ammonius,</hi> who had himself also bestow'd not the worst [part of his Time] in Mathematical Philosophy, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with what had been spoken, and said: <q>'Tis not meet too eagerly to oppose these young Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these things, except [it be by saying,] that every one of the Numbers will afford you, if you desire to praise it, no small [Subject of Commendations.] And what need is there to speak of others? For the Septe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, sacred to <hi>Apollo,</hi> will take up a Days time, before one can in Words run through all its Powers. We shall therefore pronounce, that the wise Men [or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges] do at once contest both against common Law, and a long [Series of] Time, if, throwing the Septe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary out of its Seat, they shall consecrate the Quina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the God, as being more suitable to him. I am therefore of Opinion, that this Syllable signifies nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Number, Order, nor Connexion, nor any other of the deficient Parts, but is a self-perfect Appellation and Salutation of the God, which together with [the Pronunciation of] the Word, brings the Speaker to the Conception of his Power. For the God in a manner calls upon every one of us, who comes hither, with this Salutation, <hi>Know thy self:</hi> which is nothing inferior to [that other Expression] <hi>All hail.</hi> And we again, answering the God, say to him <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>thou art;</hi> attributing to him the true, unfeign'd, and Sole Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Being, [as] agreeing to him alone.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For we indeed do not at all essentially partake of Being, but every mortal Nature, being in the midst between Generation and Corruption, exbibits an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and obscure and weak Opinion of it self: and if you fix your Thought, desiring to comprehend it, as the hard Grasping of Water, by the pressing and squeezing together, that which is fluid, loses that,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:46327:280"/> which is held: so the Passions changing, Reason, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing too evident a Perception of every thing, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, partly as to its Generation, and partly to its Corruption, being able to apprehend Nothing, either remaining, or really subsisting. For we cannot, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> says, descend twice into the same River, or twice find any perishable Substance in the same State; but by the Suddenness and Swiftness of the Change it disperses, and again gathers together, comes and goes: whence what is generated of it, reaches not to the Perfection of Being, because the Generation never ceases, nor is it at an End; but always changing, of Seed it makes an Embryo, next an Infant, then a Child, then a Stripling, after that a young Man, then a full-grown Man, an elderly Man, [and lastly,] a decrepit old Man, corrupting the [precedent or] former Generations and Statures by the subsequent [or later.] But we ridiculously fear one Death, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already so often dy'd, and dying. For not only, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> said, in the Death of Fire the Generation of Air, and the Death of Air the Generation of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but you may see this more plainly in Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for the full-grown Man perishes, when the old Man comes, as the Youth terminated in the full-grown Man, the Child in the Youth, the Infant in the Child: so Yesterday dy'd in To day, and To day dies in To morrow: so that none remains, nor is one, but we are generated many about one Phantasm, and common Mould, the Matter sliding and turning about. For how do we, if remaining the same, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in other things, [than we delighted in before?] How do we love, hate, admire, and contemn things, contrary to the former? How do we use other Words, and other Passions, not having the same Form, Figure, or Understanding? For neither is it probable, we should be thus differently afflicted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:46327:281"/> Change, neither is he, who changes the same. And if he is not the same, neither is he at all, but changing from the same, changes also his Being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made one from another. But the Sense is deceiv'd through the Ignorance of Being, supposing that to be, which appears.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>What then is it that has really a Being? That which is eternal, unbegotten, and incorruptible, to which no Time brings a Change. For Time is a certain moveable thing, appearing as a Shadow with fleeting Matter, always flowing and unstable, like a Vessel of Corruption and Generation: of which the Saying, <hi>After,</hi> and <hi>Before, It has been,</hi> and <hi>It shall be,</hi> is of it self a Confession, that it has no Being. For to say, that what never was, or what has already ceas'd to be, is in being, how foolish and absurd it is. And as for that, on which we chiefly ground the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Time, saying, the <hi>Instant, Present,</hi> and <hi>Now,</hi> Reason again, wholly discovering it, does imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately overthrow it: for it is press'd between the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Past, as desiring to see it necessarily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated into two.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now if the same thing befalls Nature, which we measure by Time, as does the Measure of it, there is nothing in it permanent or subsistent, but all things are either breeding, or dying, according to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture with Time. Whence also it is not lawful to say of any thing, which is, that it was, or shall be: for these are Inclinations and Departures, and Changes of that, whose Nature is not to continue in Being. But GOD, we must say, IS, and he is not according to any Time, but according to Eternity, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, without Time, and free from Inclination, in which there is nothing first, or last, or newer; but being one, it has fill'd its eternal Duration with one [only] <hi>Now,</hi> and that only is, which is really accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:46327:281"/> to this, [of which it cannot be said, that it] either was, or shall be, or that it begins, or shall end. Thus ought those, who worship, to salute and invocate this eternal Being, or else indeed, as some of the Ancients [have dome, with this Expression] <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Thou art one.</hi> For the Divinity is not many, as [is] every one of us, who are made of ten thousand Differences in Affections, being a confus'd Heap, fill'd with all Diversities, and a Mixture of all sorts of Alterations. But that, which is, must be one, as One must have a Being. But Diversity, [which is esteem'd] the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Being, goes forth to the Generation of that which is not. Whence both the first of his Names agrees rightly with this God, as do also the second and third. For he is call'd <hi>Apollo,</hi> as denying Plurality, and rejecting Multitude: and <hi>Ieios,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only one; and <hi>Phoebus</hi> was the Name given by the Ancients to every thing, that is pure and chast: as the <hi>Thessalians</hi> even to this Day, if I am not mistaken, say of their Priests, when on vacant Days they [ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from the Temples, and] keep themselves retir'd, that they do <hi>Phoebonomize,</hi> that is, purifie themselves. Now that which is one, is sincere and pure: For Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is by the Mixture of one thing with another: as <hi>Homer,</hi> speaking of a Piece of Ivory dy'd red, said, it was polluted by the Dye, and Diers say of mixt Colours, that they are <hi>corrupted,</hi> and call the Mixture it self <hi>Corruption.</hi> 'Tis therefore always requisite for that, which is incorruptible and pure, to be one and unmixt. Now as for those who think <hi>Apollo</hi> and the Sun to be the same, they are to be caress'd and lov'd for their Ingenuity, [as] placing the Notion of God in that, which they most reverence of all things, that they know and desire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And now, as if we were dreaming of God the most glorious Dream [imaginable,] let us stir up and exhort
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:46327:282"/> our selves to ascend higher, and to contemplate what is above us, and [principally to adore his] Essence; but to honour also this his Image, [the Sun,] and to venerate that Generative [Faculty, he has plac'd] in it, exhibiting in some sort by its Brightness, as far as 'tis possible for a sensible thing [to represent] an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and a moveable thing, that, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, certain Manifestations and Resemblances of his Benignity and Blessedness. But as for those his Sallyings out and Changes, when he casts forth Fire, which, as they say, at the same time distract him, and when he again draws himself in, afterwards extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself into the Earth, Sea, Winds, Animals, and strange Accidents both of Animals and Plants, they cannot so much as be hearkned to without Impiety, or else the God will be worse than the Child in the Poet, who made himself Sport with an Heap of Sand, first rais'd, and then again scatter'd abroad by himself, if he shall do the same in respect of the Universe, first framing the World, when it was not, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying it, when made. On the contrary, whatsoever of him is in any sort infus'd into the World, that binds together its Substance, and restrains the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Weakness, which tends to Corruption. And this Word seems to me to have been chiefly oppos'd to that Doctrine, and that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, [or <hi>Thou art</hi>] is spoken to this God, as testifying, that there is never in him any going forth or Change. But to do and suffer this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to a certain other God, or rather <hi>Daemon,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd [to take care] about Nature in Generation and Corruption, as is immediately manifest from their Names, being wholly contrary, and of different Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications. For the one is call'd <hi>Apollo,</hi> [or <hi>Not many,</hi>] the other <hi>Pluto,</hi> [or <hi>Many;</hi>] the one <hi>Delius</hi> [from Clearness,] the other <hi>Aidoneus</hi> [from Obscurity;] the one <hi>Phoebus,</hi> [or Shining,] the other <hi>Scotius,</hi> [of

<q>"He is condemn'd to be for ever Childless.</q> And therefore <hi>Euripides</hi> rightly also said:

                        <l>"With which gold-hair'd <hi>Apollo</hi>'s no way pleas'd.</l>

                     </q>
                     <hi>Sophocles</hi> also evidently attributes to either of them his proper Instruments, in these Words:
<q>
                        <l>"Neither the Lute nor Psaltery is fit</l>
                        <l>"For mournful Matters—</l>
                     </q> For 'tis but very lately, and in a manner of yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that the Pipe or Hautbois has dar'd to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it self into delightful Matters; having in former times drawn Men to Mourning, and possessing about these things no very honorable or splendid Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it was afterwards wholly intermixt. But those especially, who confounded the Affairs of

               </p>
               <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>ANtiphon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sophilus,</hi> by Descent a <hi>Rhamnusian,</hi> was his Fathers Scholar, for he kept a Rhetorick-School, to which, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> himself had recourse in his Youth. Having attain'd to competent measure of Knowledge and Eloquence, and that, as some believe, from his own Natural Ingenuity, he dedicated his Study chiefly to Affairs of State. And yet he was for some time conversant in the Schools, and had a Controversie with <hi>Socrates</hi> the Philosoper, about the Reason of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting; not so much for the Sake of Contention, as the Profit of Arguing, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> tells us; in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries on the Sayings and Actions of <hi>Socrates.</hi> At the Request of some Citizens he wrote Orations, by which they defended their Suits at Law; and some say, that he was the first that ever did any thing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For it is certain there is not one Juridicial-Oration extant, written by any Orator that liv'd before him,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:46327:284"/> nor by his Contemporaries neither, as <hi>Themistocles, Aristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Pericles,</hi> though the Times gave them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and there was need enough of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in such Business. Not that we are to impute it to their Want of Parts, that they did nothing in this way, for we may inform our selves of the contrary from what Historians relate of each of 'em. Besides, if we inspect the most Antient, <hi>viz. Alcibiades, Critias, Lisias</hi> and <hi>Archinous,</hi> who we shall find, that though they wrote in one and the same Stile, and had the same Form and Method in their Pleadings, yet they were in a great Measure beholding to <hi>Antiphon,</hi> when he was old. For being a Man of incomparable Sagacity, he was the first that published Institutions of Oratory; and by reason of his profound Learning, he was Sirnamed <hi>Nestor. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius,</hi> in a Tract which he wrote of him, supposes him to have been <hi>Thucidides</hi>'s Pupil, from what <hi>Antiphon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in praise of him. He is most accurate in his Orations; in Invention subtil; and would frequently baffle his Adversary at unawares, by a covert sort of Pleading; in troublesome and intricate Matters he was very judicious and sharp; and as he was a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of Ornamental Speaking, he would always adapt his Orations to both Law and Reason.</p>
                  <p>He liv'd about the Time of the <hi>Persian</hi> War, and of <hi>Gorgias</hi> the <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> being somewhat younger than he. And he lived to see the Subversion of the Popular Government in the Common-wealth, which was wrought by the four hundred Conspirators, in which he himself is thought to have had the chiefest Hand, being sometimes Commander of two Gallies, and sometimes holding the Praetorship, and having by the many and great Victories he obtain'd, gain'd them many Allies, he armed the young Men, man'd out sixty Gallies, and on all their Occasions went Ambassador to <hi>Lacedaemonia,</hi> at what time <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>etionia</hi> was fortified. But when those four
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:46327:284"/> hundred were overcome and taken down, he, with <hi>Archiptolemus,</hi> who was likewise one of the same Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was accused of the Conspiracy, Condemned and Sentensed to the Punishment due to Traytors, his Body cast out unburied, and all his Posterity infamous on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. But there are some, who tell us, that he was put to Death by the thirty Tyrants; and among the rest, <hi>Lysias,</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Antiphon</hi>'s Daughter, says the same, for he left a little Daughter, whom <hi>Callaeschius</hi> claim'd for his Wife by the Law of Propinquity. And <hi>Theopompus</hi> likewise in his fifteenth Book of his <hi>Philippicks,</hi> tells us the same thing. But he is more tender of his Reputation than <hi>Lycidonidas</hi> his Father; and so is <hi>Crati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his Pytine, in that he does not mention the Evil he was guilty of. But how could he be Executed in the Time of the four Hundred, and afterward live to be put to Death by the Thirty Tyrants? There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise anoother Story of the Manner of his Death. That when he was old he sail'd to <hi>Syracuse,</hi> when the Tyranny of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the First, was most famous; and being at Table, a Question was put, What sort of Brass was best? When others had answered, as they thought most proper, he replied; <hi>That is the best Brass, of which the Statues of</hi> Hermodius <hi>and</hi> Aristogiton <hi>were made.</hi> Which the Tyrant hearing, and taking it as a tacit Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to his Subjects to contrive his Ruine, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Antiphon</hi> to be put to Death; and as some say, he unjustly gave out, that he was put to Death for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding his Tragedies.</p>
                  <p>This Orator is reported to have written sixty Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but <hi>Caecilius</hi> supposes twenty five of them to be spurious and none of his. <hi>Plato,</hi> in his Comedies with <hi>Pisander,</hi> traduces him as a Covetous Man. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have composed some of his Tragedies alone, and others with <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant. While he was Poetically inclined, he invented an Art of Curing the
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:46327:285"/> Distemper of the Mind, as Physicians are wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise Cure of bodily Diseases. And having at <hi>Corinth</hi> built him a little House, in or near the Market, he set a Postscript over the Gate, to this effect: <hi>That he had a way to cure the Distemper of Mens Minds by Words; and let him but know the cause of their Malady, he would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately prescribe the Remedy, to their Comfort.</hi> But after some time, thinking that Art not worth his while, he betook himself to the Study and Teaching of Oratory. There are some who ascribe the Book of <hi>Glaucus Rheginus</hi> concerning Poets, to him as Author of it. His Orations concerning <hi>Herodotus,</hi> to <hi>Erasistratus</hi> concerning Ideas, are very much commended: and that which, when he was accused, he penn'd for himself, against a Law not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded; and that against <hi>Demosthenes</hi> the Praetor, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publick Offences. He likewise had another against <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Praetor, in which he condemn'd him for his Contempt, in that he did not appear on the Day appointed for his Tryal: and this was done in the very time when <hi>Theopompus</hi> was Governor of the City, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose Government the Power of the four hundred Conspirators was overthrown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caecilius</hi> has recorded the Decree of the Senate, for the Judicial Tryal of <hi>Antiphon,</hi> in these Words: That on the one and twentieth Day of <hi>Prytaneia, Demonicus Alopecensis</hi> being then Notary-Publick, <hi>Philostratus Pelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis</hi> preferr'd a Bill from the Senate, wherein it was decreed, that those Men, <hi>viz. Archeptolemus, Oromacles,</hi> and <hi>Antiphon,</hi> whom the Praetors had declar'd against, for that they went in an Embassage to <hi>Lacedaemonia,</hi> to the great Damage of the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> and departed from the Camp in an Enemies Ship, and so went through <hi>Decelia</hi> by Land; that they shou'd be apprehended and kept in Prison, till they should be brought to a legal Tryal: That the Praetors themselves, with others of the Senate, to the Number of ten, whom it should please
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:46327:285"/> them to name and chuse, should look after them to keep them safe till Judgment shou'd be pass'd upon 'em: That <hi>Thesmothetes</hi> shou'd on the Morrow after their Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, judicially cite the said Prisoners before the Judges, both the Leaders, and others of the Conspiracy, where the Bill being read, wherein they were accused of Treason, whoever had any thing to say against 'em, he shou'd be heard: That whoever shou'd then be Condemn'd, shou'd have Sentence pronounc'd against him, according to the prescript Form of Condemnation, appointed by the Law in the Case of Treason. At the bottom of this Decree was subscribed, <hi>Archeptolemus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hippodamus Agrylensis;</hi> and <hi>Antiphon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sophilus</hi> the <hi>Ramnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> being both present in Court, are condemned of Treason. And this was to be their Punishment; That they shou'd be deliver'd to the eleven Executioners, their Goods confiscated, the tenth part of 'em being first consecrated to <hi>Minerva;</hi> their Houses to be level'd with the Ground, and in the Places where they stood, this Subscription to be engraven on Brass: The House of <hi>Archeptolemus</hi> and of <hi>Antiphon</hi> Traytors. * * * That <hi>Archeptolemus</hi> and <hi>Antiphon</hi> shou'd neither of 'em be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Athens,</hi> nor any where else under that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And besides all this, that their Memory shou'd be accounted infamous to Posterity, as well the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Bastards as of their lawful Progeny: and he too was lookt upon with the same Contempt, who shou'd adopt any one of their Progeny for his Son. In a Word, that all this shou'd be engross'd and engraven on a Brass Column, and that Column to be placed, where that stands, on which is engraven the Decree concerning <hi>Phrynicus.</hi>

                     <hi>ANdocides,</hi> the Son of that <hi>Leogoras,</hi> who once made a Peace with the <hi>Athenians</hi> against the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> by Descent a <hi>Cydathenian</hi> or <hi>Phucian,</hi> of a Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and as <hi>Hellanicus</hi> tells us, if we may believe him, the Off-spring of <hi>Mercury</hi> himself: for the Race of Heraulds belong to him: and on this account he was chosen by the People to go with <hi>Glaucen,</hi> with twenty Sail of Ships to aid the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> against the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> But in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of time, being accused of some notorious Acts of Impiety; as that he was of the Number of those who defaced the Statues of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and divulg'd the Sacred Mysteries of <hi>Ceres;</hi> and withal, being accused of Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Intemperance, and that he had been seen in the Night in Masquerade to break one of the Statues of <hi>Mercury;</hi> and when he refus'd to bring his Servant to Examination, whom his Accusers named, he was not only convicted of the first, but also was very much sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be guilty of the second Crime too. Which later Action was laid to his Charge soon after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of the Navy sent by the <hi>Athenians</hi> into <hi>Sicily.</hi> For as <hi>Cratippus</hi> informs us, when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> sent the <hi>Leontines</hi> and <hi>Aegesians</hi> to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were to lend them Assistance <hi>in cognito,</hi> they in the Night defaced and brake all the Statues of <hi>Mercury</hi> which were erected in the Market. To which Offence, <hi>Andocides</hi> having added another, that of divulging the Mysteries of <hi>Ceres,</hi> he was brought to his Tryal, but was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, on condition he wou'd discover who were Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with him in the Crime. In which Affair, being very diligent, he found out who they were that had been guilty, and among the rest, he discover'd his own Father. He prov'd all guilty, and caus'd them all to be put to Death, only his Father, whom he sav'd,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:46327:286"/> though in Prison, by a Promise of some eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he wou'd do to the Common-wealth. Nor did he fail of what he promis'd; for <hi>Leogoras</hi> accused many who had acted in several Matters against the Interest of the Common-wealth, and for this was acquitted of his own Crime.</p>
                  <p>Now, though <hi>Andocides</hi> was very much esteemed of for his Skill in the Management of the Affairs of the Common-wealth; yet his Inclinations led him rather to Trafick by Sea: and by this means he contracted Friendship with the Kings of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and other great Princes. At which time he privily stole a Damsel of the City, the Daughter of <hi>Aristides,</hi> and his own Neece, and sent her as a Present to the King of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> But suspecting he shou'd be call'd in question for it, he again stole her from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> for which the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> took him and clapt him up in Prison; whence he brake loose and return'd to <hi>Athens,</hi> just at that time when the four hundred Conspirators had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped the Government. By whom being confined, he again escaped, when the Power of Governing was lodg'd in a few. But when the thirty Tyrants were upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, he withdrew to <hi>Elis,</hi> and there lived, till <hi>Thrasy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> and his Faction returned into the City, and then he also repair'd thither. And after some time, being sent into <hi>Lacedaemonia</hi> to conciliate a Peace, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain suspected to be faulty, and on that Suspicion ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
                  <p>He himself has given an account of all these Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in his Orations which he has left behind him. For some of 'em treat of the Crime of him who shakes off his Religion by a Violation of its Laws, as he did when he divulg'd the Mysteries of <hi>Ceres:</hi> Others represent a convicted Person begging Mercy of the Judge: and there is one extant, wherein he makes a Discovery of the wicked Practises of others, and one to
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:46327:287"/>
                     <hi>Phaeax,</hi> and one concerning Peace. He flourished at the same time with <hi>Socrates</hi> the Philosopher; he was born in the seventy eighth Olympiate, when <hi>Theogenides</hi> was Governour of <hi>Athens,</hi> so that he shou'd seem to be almost an hundred years before <hi>Lysias.</hi> There is an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Mercury,</hi> call'd from his Name <hi>Andocideum,</hi> being given by the House of <hi>Aegis,</hi> and it stood near the House where <hi>Andocides</hi> dwelt. This <hi>Andocides</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was at the Charge of a publick Revel, in memory of the Name and House of <hi>Aegeis,</hi> at the Celebration of the<note n="*" place="margin">Feasts or Songs dedicated to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
                     </note> Dithyram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicks. And having gain'd a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he erected a Tripos on an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent opposite to the Country of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Selinus.</hi> His Stile in his Orations is plain and easie, without the least Affectation, or any thing of a Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ornament.</p>

At his first coming, he was educated among the most Noble of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> But when the City sent a Colony to <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baris,</hi> which was afterwards call'd <hi>Thurii,</hi> he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his elder Brother <hi>Polemarchus,</hi> his Father being now dead, for he had two other Brothers, <hi>Eudemus</hi>
                     <pb n="555" facs="tcp:46327:287"/> and <hi>Brachillus,</hi> that he might receive his Portion, or part of his Fathers Estate. This was done in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of his Age, when <hi>Praxiteles</hi> was Governour. There then he staid, and was brought up under <hi>Nicias</hi> and <hi>Tisias,</hi> both <hi>Syracusians.</hi> And having purchas'd a House, he liv'd as a Citizen for about sixty three years, till the Regency of <hi>Clearchus,</hi> having been Governour himself in his turn. In the Year following, in the Time of <hi>Gallias, viz.</hi> in the ninety second Olympiade, when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had War with the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Allies revolted, and especially the <hi>Italians,</hi> he being accused of favouring the <hi>Athenians,</hi> with three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Association was banish'd; when coming to <hi>Athens,</hi> in the Year wherein <hi>Gallias</hi> succeeded <hi>Cleocritus</hi> in the Government, which then labour'd under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the four hundred Conspirators, he there sate down. But after the Fight at<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Aegospotamos,</hi> when the Thirty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants had usurp'd the Government, he was banished thence for seven Years, his Goods confiscated, and having likewise lost his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Polemarchus,</hi> he himself escaped by a Back-door of the House in which he was kept, fled to <hi>Megara,</hi> and there lived as one without hope of Recovery. But when the Citizens endeavour'd to return from <hi>Phila,</hi> he also behaved himself very well, and appear'd very active in the Affair, having, to forward this great Enterprize, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited two thousand Drachms of Silver, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Targets, and being Commission'd with <hi>Hermanes,</hi> he maintain'd three hundred and two Men in Arms, and prevail'd with <hi>Thrasilaeus</hi> the <hi>Elian,</hi> his old Friend and Host, to contribute some Talents. Upon his entring the City <hi>Thrasibulus</hi> proposed, that for a Consideration of his good Service to the Publick, he should take upon him the Administration of the Common-wealth, and be invested with the Government before <hi>Euclides.</hi> Which Proposal
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:46327:288"/> being ratified by the People, <hi>Archimus</hi> objected that it was against the Laws, and a Judgment without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and therefore void of it self. Whereupon being deceiv'd of his Right of Governing, he led the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Life in private, and died at last at <hi>Athens,</hi> being fourscore and three years old, or as some would have it, seventy six: and others again say, that he liv'd above fourscore years, till after the Birth of <hi>Demosthenes.</hi> 'Tis suppos'd he was born in the Year of <hi>Philocles.</hi> There are four hundred and twenty five Orations which bear his Name, of which <hi>Dionysius</hi> and <hi>Cecilius</hi> affirm only two hundred and thirty to be genuine: and he is said to have been overcome but twice in all. There is extant also the Oration which he made in defence of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Decree against <hi>Archimus,</hi> wherein he shews what Right he had to it, by his Conversation in the Common-wealth: as also another against the thirty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. He was very cogent in his Perswasions, and was always very brief in what he deliver'd. He would commonly give Orations to private Persons. There are likewise his Institutions of Oratory, his Lectures and Epistles, his Elogies, Funeral Orations, Discourses of Love, and his Defence of <hi>Socrates,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the Minds of the Judges. His Stile seems plain and easie, though hardly imitable. <hi>Demos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes</hi> in his Oration against <hi>Neaera,</hi> says that he was in Love with one <hi>Metanira, Neaera</hi>'s Serving maid; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards married his Brother <hi>Brachillus</hi>'s Daughter. <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phedrus</hi> makes mention of him, as a most eloquent Orator, and antienter than <hi>Isocrates. Philiscus,</hi> his Companion, and <hi>Isocrates</hi>'s Votary, composed an Epigram concerning him, whence the<note n="*" place="margin">That he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Isocrates.</hi>
                     </note> same that we have urg'd from <hi>Plato</hi> is deducible: and it sings to this effect:

                        <l>For 'tis decreed that thou shalt bear a Son,</l>

                        <l>And are receiv'd for Glorious above.</l>

                  <p>He likewise wrote an Oration for <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> against <hi>Harmodius;</hi> and another accusing <hi>Timotheus</hi> of Treason, in both which he overcame. But when <hi>Iphicrates</hi> took upon him the Examination of <hi>Timotheus</hi>'s Actions, and wou'd purge him of the Allegation of Treason, <hi>Lycias</hi> wrote an Oration for him to deliver in his Defence: upon which he was acquitted; but <hi>Timotheus</hi> was fined in a considerable Sum of Money.

                  <p>
                     <hi>ISocrates</hi> was the Son of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and <hi>Erechthian,</hi> reckon'd among the meaner sort of Citizens, and a Man who kept Servants under him to make Flutes, by which he got so much Money, as enabled him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring up his Children after the most gentile Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but likewise to maintain a Choire, (for besides <hi>Iso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> he had other Sons, <hi>viz. Telesippus,</hi> and <hi>Diomnestus,</hi> and one Daughter.) And hence we may suppose those two comical Poets, <hi>Aristophanes</hi> and <hi>Stratis,</hi> took occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bring him on the Stage. He lived about the eighty sixth Olympiade, <hi>Lysimachus</hi> the <hi>Myrrhinusian</hi>
                     <pb n="558" facs="tcp:46327:289"/> being Governour, about two and twenty Years after <hi>Lysias,</hi> and seven before <hi>Plato.</hi> When he was a Boy, he was as well educated as any of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Children, being under the Tuition of <hi>Prodicus</hi> the <hi>Cean, Gorgias</hi> the <hi>Leontine, Tisias</hi> the <hi>Syracusan,</hi> and <hi>Theramenes</hi> the <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> whom when he was to be apprehended by the Order of the Thirty Tyrants, and flying for Succor to the Altar of the Senate, only <hi>Isocrates</hi> stood his Friend, and for a long time conceal'd him. But after some time <hi>Theramenes</hi> advised him to desist, because, he told him, it would be an Aggravation of his Grief, if any of his Friends should come into Trouble for and with him. And 'tis said, that he made use of certain Institutions of Rhetorick, composed by him when he was slandered in Court: which Institutions have since born <hi>Boton</hi>'s Name.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Isocrates</hi> was come to Man's Estate, he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with nothing of State Affairs, both because he had a very weak Voice, and because he was something ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous; and besides these two Impediments, his Estate was much impair'd by the Loss of a great part of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony in the War with the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> It is the Opinion of some, that he compos'd some Orations, and especially one concerning Barter. Having set up a School, he gave himself much to Writing, and the Study of Phylosophy, and then he wrote his Panegyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Oration, and others which were used for Advice, some of which he deliver'd himself, and others he gave to others to pronounce for him; aiming thereby to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the Study and Practice of such things as were of most immediate concern to them. But his Endeavours in that way proving to no purpose, he gave those things over, and opened a School in <hi>Chios</hi> first, as some will have it, having for a Beginning nine Scholars: and when they came to him to pay him for their Schooling, he weeping said, <hi>Now I see plainly
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:46327:289"/> that I am sold to my Scholars.</hi> He admitted all into his Acquaintance who desir'd it. He was the first that made a Separation between Brawling, and solid Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Arguments, to which latter he rather addicted himself. He instituted a Form of Magistracy in <hi>Chios,</hi> much the same with that at <hi>Athens.</hi> No School-master ever got so much Money by the Profession as he did: for he got so much, that he built and maintain'd a Galley at his own Charge. He had more than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Scholars, and among others, <hi>Timotheus</hi> the Son of <hi>Conon</hi> was one, with whom he visited many Cities, and composed these Epistles which <hi>Timotheus</hi> sent to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> who for his pains gave him a Talent out of that which he got of <hi>Samos. Theopompus</hi> likewise, the <hi>Chian, Ephorus</hi> the <hi>Cumean, Asclepiades</hi> the Writer of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, and <hi>Theodecles,</hi> who afterwards wrote Tragedies too, were all <hi>Isocrates</hi>'s Scholars. (The last of these had a Monument in the way to <hi>Cyamites,</hi> as we go to <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines,</hi> of which now remains only Rubbish, there also he set up with his, the Statues of other famous Poets, of all which, only <hi>Homer</hi>'s is to be seen.) <hi>Leodamus</hi> also the <hi>Athenian,</hi> and <hi>Lacritus</hi> who gave Laws to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> were both his Scholars: and some say <hi>Hyperides</hi> and <hi>Isaeus</hi> too. They add likewise, that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> also was very desirous to learn of him; and because he cou'd not give the full Rate, which was a thousand Drachms, he offer'd him two hundred, the fifth part, if he wou'd teach him but the fifth part of his Art pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable: to whom <hi>Isocrates</hi> answer'd, <hi>We do not use,</hi> Demosthenes, <hi>to impart our Skill by halves, but as Men sell good Fish whole, or altogether, so, if thou hast a Desire to learn, we will teach thee our full Art, and not a piece of it.</hi> He died in the Year when <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="560" facs="tcp:46327:290"/> he then made, pronouncing just at his Departure the three Verses which begin the three Tragedies of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides:</hi>

                  <p>He lived ninety eight Years, or, as some say, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, not being able to behold <hi>Greece</hi> the fourth time brought into Slavery. The Year, or as some say, four Years before he died, he wrote his Panethenaic Oration: his Panegyrick Oration ten Years before, or as some tell us, fifteen, which he is supposed to have translated out of <hi>Gorgias</hi> the <hi>Leontine,</hi> and <hi>Lysias.</hi> His Oration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Barter, he wrote when he was eighty two years old; and that to <hi>Philip</hi> a little before his Death. When he was old, he adopted <hi>Aphareus,</hi> the youngest of the three Sons of <hi>Plathane,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Hippias</hi> the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whom he married for his Son. He was very rich, both in respect of the great Sums of Money he exacted of his Scholars; and besides that, he had at one time twenty Talents of <hi>Nicocles,</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> for an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he dedicated to him. By reason of his Riches he became obnoxious to the Envy of others, and was three times named to build a Galley, which he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded twice by the Assistance of his Son and a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Sickness; but the third time he undertook it, though the Charge prov'd very great. A Father tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that he had allow'd his Son no other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than one Slave: <hi>Isocrates</hi> reply'd, <hi>Go thy way then, for one Slave thou shalt have two.</hi> He strove for the Prize which <hi>Artemisia</hi> dedicated to the Honour and Memory of her Husband <hi>Mausolus;</hi> but that Oration is lost. He wrote also another Oration in praise of <hi>Helen,</hi> and one for <hi>Areopagus.</hi> Some say, that he died when he had
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:46327:290"/> fasted nine Days, some again, at four days end; and that his Death took its Date from the Funeral Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of those that lost their Lives at <hi>Cheronea.</hi> His Son <hi>Aphareus</hi> likewise wrote several Orations. He lies buried with all his Family near <hi>Synosarges,</hi> on the Left-hand of the Hill: For there are interr'd <hi>Isocrates</hi> and his Father <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and his Mother, and her Sister <hi>Anaco,</hi> and his adoptive Son <hi>Aphareus, Socrates</hi> the Son of <hi>Anaco,</hi> and <hi>Isocrates</hi> his Brother, bearing his Father's Name, and <hi>Isocrates</hi>'s Nephews, the Sons of <hi>Aphareus, Aphareus</hi> and his Father <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Platha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> the Mother of his adopted <hi>Aphareus▪</hi> On the Tombs of whom were erected six Tables, which are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished. But upon the Tomb of <hi>Isocrates</hi> himself was placed a Ram thirty Cubits high, and on that a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid of seven Cubits; which was an Emblem of his Eloquence; there is nothing more extant. There was also near it a Table having his Poets and School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster on it; and among the rest, <hi>Gorgias</hi> inspecting a Caelestial Globe, and <hi>Isocrates</hi> standing by him. There is likewise a Statue of his of Brass in <hi>Eleusine,</hi> dedicated by <hi>Timothy</hi> the Son of <hi>Conon,</hi> before the Entry of the Porch, with this Inscription;

                  <p>He was wantonly given: and used to lie upon a Straw Mat for his Bed, and his Bolster was commonly made moist with Saffron. He never married while he
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:46327:291"/> was young, but in his old Age he kept a Miss, whose Name was <hi>Lagisca,</hi> and by her he had a Daughter, who died in the twelfth Year of her Age, before she was married. He afterward married <hi>Plathane,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Hippia</hi> the <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> who had three Sons, the youngest of which, <hi>Aphareus</hi> by Name, he adopted for his own, as we said before; and he erected a brazen Statue to him near <hi>Olympius,</hi> as it were a Column, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription to this purpose:

                     </q> He is said to have run a Race on a swift Horse, when he was but a Boy; for he is to be seen in this Posture in the Cittadel or Tower, in the Tennis Court of the Priests of <hi>Minerva,</hi> in a Statue. There were but two Suits commenced against him in his whole Life: one whereof was with <hi>Megaclides,</hi> who provoked him to Barter; at the Tryal of which, he could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally present, by reason of Sickness; but sending <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phareus,</hi> he nevertheless overcame. The other Suit was commenced against him by <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> who wou'd have him come to a Barter, and likewise to be at the Charge of maintaining a Galley for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. In this Case he was overthrown, and forced to deposite the Money. But there was likewise a piece of Painting of his in <hi>Pompeium. Aphareus</hi> also wrote O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations both judicial and deliberative; as also a few Tragedies, to the Number of thirty seven; of which, two are answer'd. He began to make his Works pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in the Year of <hi>Lysistratus,</hi> and continued it to the Year of <hi>Sisigenes,</hi> that is, eight and twenty Years: He

                  <p>HE was the Son of that <hi>Atrometus,</hi> who being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the thirty Tyrants, was thereby a Means of reducing the Common-wealth to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People, and of his Wife <hi>Glaucothea;</hi> by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent a <hi>Cothocidian.</hi> He was neither nobly born, nor Rich; but in his Youth, being strong and well set, he addicted himself to all sorts of bodily Exercises; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, if we may credit <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> having a very clear Voice, and good Pronunciation, he took to play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tragedies, and in this he served <hi>Aristodemus</hi> in his Bacchanals, playing in the School only the third Parts of the ancient Tragedies. When he was but a Boy, he was assisting to his Father in teaching little Children their Letters, and when he was grown up, he listed himself a private Centinel. Some think he was brought up under <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato;</hi> but <hi>Caecilius</hi> will have it that <hi>Leodamus</hi> was his Master. Being concern'd in the Affairs of the Common-wealth, he openly acted in opposition to <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and his Faction; and was therefore employed in several Embassies, and especially in one to <hi>Philip,</hi> to treat about Articles of Peace. For which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> accused him for being the Cause of the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and Ruine of the <hi>Phocaeans,</hi> and the Enflamer of War; which part he would have him thought to have acted in the Diet of the <hi>Amphyctions,</hi> who chose him one of their Deputies in that Assembly; and having made them a convenient Haven, put themselves under <hi>Philips</hi> Protection, who being assisted by <hi>Aeschines,</hi> took the Affair in hand, and soon conquer'd all <hi>Phocis:</hi> But <hi>Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,</hi> notwithstanding all that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> could do, being favour'd by <hi>Eubulus</hi> the Son of <hi>Spintharus,</hi> a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballusian,</hi> who pleaded in his Behalf, he carried his Cause by thirty Voices, and so was clear'd. Though
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:46327:293"/> some tell us, that there were Orations prepared by some Orators; but the News of the Conquest of <hi>Chaeronea</hi> put a stop to the present Proceedings, and so the Suit fell.</p>
                  <p>Some time after this, <hi>Philip</hi> being dead, and his Son <hi>Alexander</hi> marching into <hi>Asia, Aeschines</hi> impeached <hi>Ctasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> for acting against the Laws, in passing a Decree in favour of <hi>Demosthenes.</hi> But he having not the fifth part of the Voices of the People on his side, he was forced to go in Exile to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> because he would not pay the Mulct of a thousand Drachms, in which he was fined, being overthrown at the Bar. Others say, that to add to his Crime, he would not depart the City; and that he went to <hi>Alexander</hi> at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> But upon the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> when the Tumult was at the highest, he went to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and there opened a School and taught. And on a time pronouncing the Oration which he had formerly made against <hi>Ctesiphon</hi> to pleasure the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> he did it with that Grace, that they wondred how he cou'd fail of carrying his Cause, if he pleaded so well for himself: <hi>But, wonder not,</hi> said he, <hi>that I was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, because ye did not hear</hi> Demosthenes <hi>pleading against me.</hi> He left a School behind him at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> which was afterwards call'd the <hi>Rhodian</hi> School. Thence he sailed to <hi>Samos,</hi> and there in a short time died. He had a very good Voice, as both <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chares</hi> testifie of him.</p>
                  <p>Four Orations bear his Name, one of which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Timarchus,</hi> one concerning a false Ambassage, a third against <hi>Cetesiphon,</hi> which three are really his own; but the fourth, called <hi>Deliaca,</hi> is none of his; for though he was named to plead the Cause of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Delos,</hi> yet <hi>Demosthenes</hi> tells us, that <hi>Hyperides</hi> was chosen in his stead. He says himself, that he had two Brothers, <hi>Aphobus</hi> and <hi>Demochares.</hi> He was the first that brought the <hi>Athenians</hi> the News of the Victory obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:46327:293"/> at <hi>Tamyne,</hi> for which he was crowned. Some report that <hi>Aeschines</hi> was never any Mans Scholar; but having learned to writ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Being imploy'd with <hi>Ctesiphon</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in an Embassage to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> to treat of Peace, he appear'd the most accomplished of the three. Another time also he was the tenth Man sent in Ambassage to conclude a Peace, and being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward call'd to answer it, he was acquitted, as we said before.</p>

                     <hi>LYcurgus</hi> was the Son of <hi>Lycophron,</hi> and Grand-Son of that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> whom the thirty Tyrants put to Death, by the Procurement of <hi>Aristodemus</hi> the <hi>Batesian,</hi> who also being Questor, or Treasurer of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was banished in the time of the Popular Government. He was a <hi>Butadian</hi> by Country, of the Line or Family of the <hi>Etrobutades.</hi> He receiv'd his first Institutions of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy from <hi>Plato</hi> the Philosopher. But afterward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring himself a Scholar to <hi>Isocrates</hi> the Orator, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his Study about Affairs of the Common-wealth. And to his care was committed the Disposal and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the City Stock, and so he executed the Office of Treasurer General for the space of fifteen Years: in which time there went through his Hands fourteen Millions of Talents, or, as some will have it, fourscore Millions, six hundred and fifty. It was the
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:46327:294"/> Orator <hi>Stratocles</hi> that procured him this Preferment, who as his Friend recommended him to the People, though he was first chosen for his own Sake, for there was a Law, that no Man shou'd be chosen Treasurer for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Term of five Years. But <hi>Lycurgus</hi> plied his Business closely, both Summer and Winter, in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of publick Affairs, and being entrusted to make Provision of all Necessaries for the Wars, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed many Abuses that were crept into the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. He built four hundred Galleys for the use of the Publick: And prepar'd and fitted a Place for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Exercises in <hi>Lyceum,</hi> and planted Trees before it; he likewise built a Wrestling Court, and was at last made Surveyer of the Theatre of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> He was likewise of so great repute among all sorts, that he was entrusted with two hundred and fifty Talents of private Citizens. He adorned and beautified the City with gold and silver Vessels of state, and golden Lawrels: He likewise finished many things that were as yet imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as the Arsenals, Armories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He built a Wall also about the spacious Panathenaick Cloister, and made level a piece of uneven Ground, given by one <hi>Disicas</hi> to <hi>Lycurgus</hi> for the use of the City. The keeping of the City was committed wholly to his Care, and Power to apprehend Malefactors, of whom he clear'd the City by degrees: so that some Sophisters were wont to say, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did not dip his Pen in Ink, but in Blood. And therefore it was, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> demanded him of the People, they would not deliver him up: When <hi>Philip</hi> made the second War upon the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he was employed with <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Polyeuclus</hi> in an Embassie to <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> and other Cities. He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in great repute and esteem with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and looked upon as a Man of that Justice and Integrity, that in the Courts of Judicature his good Word was at all times prevalent on the Behalf of those Persons for
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:46327:294"/> whom he undertook to speak. He was the Author of several Laws; one of which was, that there shou'd be certain Comedies plaid at the <hi>Chytrian</hi> Solemnities, and whoever of the Poets or Players shou'd come off Victor, he shou'd thereby be invested with a Freedom, which before was not lawful: and so he revived a Solemnity, which for want of Encouragement, had for some time before been out of request. Another of his Laws, was, that the City shou'd erect Statues to the Memory of <hi>Aeschylus, Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides;</hi> and that their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies being fairly engrossed, shou'd be preserved in the publick Consistory, and that they shou'd be read by the publick Notaries, because it was not lawful for the Players to act them. A third Law proposed by him, was, that no <hi>Athenian,</hi> nor any Person inhabiting in <hi>Athens,</hi> shou'd be permitted to sell a Captive, who was free before, to be a Slave, without the Consent of his former Master. Further, that in <hi>Piraeeum</hi> there shou'd be at least three circular Dances play'd to <hi>Neptune;</hi> and that to the Victor in the first, shou'd be given ten Pounds; to the second, eight; and to the third, six. Also, that no Woman should go to <hi>Eleusine</hi> in a Coach, lest the Poor shou'd appear more despicable than the Rich, and so be dejected and cast down: and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shou'd ride in a Coach contrary to this Law shou'd be fin'd six thousand Drachms. And when even his own Wife was taken in the Violation of it, he paid to the Discoverers of it a whole Talent, for which being afterwards call'd in question by the People: <hi>See therefore,</hi> said he, <hi>I am call'd to answer for giving, and not for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As he was walking one Day in the Streets, he saw an Officer lay Hands on <hi>Xenocrates</hi> the Philosopher, and when nothing wou'd serve his turn but the Philosopher must to Prison, because he had not deposited the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute due from Strangers; he with his Staff struck the
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:46327:295"/> Officer on the Head for his unmannerly Roughness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Person of that Character, and, freeing <hi>Xenocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> cast the other in Prison in his stead. And not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Days after, <hi>Xenocrates</hi> meeting with the Children of <hi>Lycurgus, I made the more haste,</hi> said he, <hi>to them, to give your Father Thanks for his Friendship to me, because I heard his undeserved Kindness commended by all People where I go.</hi> He made likewise several Decrees, in which he made use of the Works of <hi>Euclides,</hi> one very expert in such Matters. Though he was rich enough, yet he was used to wear the same Coat, and the same Shooes every Day, both Summer and Winter. Because he was not so ready and apt as some others, to speak to any thing <hi>ax tempore,</hi> he used to meditate and study Day and Night. And to the end he might not at any time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versleep himself, and so lose time from his Study, he used to cover himself on his Bed only with a Sheep's-skin, with the Wooll on, and to lay a hard Bolster un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Head. When one reproached him for being in see with Rhetoricians, when he studied his Orations, he answered; <hi>That, if any Man wou'd promise to restore his Sons better, he wou'd give him not only a thousand Deniers, but half what he was worth.</hi> He took the Liberty of speaking boldly upon all occasions, by reason of his Greatness: as when once the <hi>Athenians</hi> interrupted him in his speaking, he cryed out, <hi>O thou</hi> Corcyraean <hi>Whip, bow many Talents art thou worth?</hi> And another time, when some wou'd rank <hi>Alexander</hi> among the Gods; <hi>What manner of God,</hi> said he, <hi>must he be, when all that go out of his Temple had need to be dipp'd in Water to purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After his Death, <hi>Menesaechmus</hi> accusing and indicting them by Virtue of an Instrument drawn by <hi>Thracyclos,</hi> his Sons were delivered to the eleven Executioners of Justice. But <hi>Demosthenes</hi> being in Exile, wrote to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to let them know that they were wrongfully
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:46327:295"/> accused, and that therefore they did not well to hear their Accusers: upon which they recanted what they had done, and set them at liberty again; <hi>Democles,</hi> who was <hi>Theophrastus</hi>'s Scholar, likewise pleading in their Defence. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and some of his Posterity were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried publickly, at, or near the Temple of <hi>Minerva Paeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where their Monuments stand in the Garden of <hi>Melanthius</hi> the Philosopher, on which are Inscriptions to <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and his Children, which are yet extant. The greatest thing he did while he lived, was his raising the Revenue of the Commons totally from sixty Talents, as he found it, to twelve hundred. When he found he must die, he was by his own appointment carried into the Temple, and into the Senate-house; being willing before his Death to give an account of his Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And no Man daring to accuse him of any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one <hi>Menesaechmus;</hi> having purged himself from those Calumnies he cast upon him, he was carried Home again, where in a short time he ended his Life. He was always accounted Honest, his Orations were commended for the Eloquence they carried in them, and though he was often accused, yet he never was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown in any Suit.</p>
                  <p>He had three Children by <hi>Callisto,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Abron,</hi> and Sister of <hi>Caloeus Abrons</hi>'s Son, by Descent a <hi>Batesian,</hi> I mean, of him, who when <hi>Chaerondas</hi> was Governor, was Treasurer, or Pay-master to the Army. Of this Affinity <hi>Dinarchus</hi> speaks in his Oration against <hi>Pastius.</hi> He left behind him three Sons, <hi>Abron, Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> and <hi>Lychophron;</hi> of which, <hi>Abron</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> died without Issue, though the first, <hi>Abron,</hi> did for some time act very acceptably and worthily in Affairs of the Common-Wealth. <hi>Lycophron</hi> marrying <hi>Callistomacha,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Philip Aixenes,</hi> begat <hi>Callisto,</hi> who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> the Son of <hi>Dinocrates</hi> the <hi>Acharnanian,</hi> to whom she bare <hi>Lycophron,</hi> who being adopted by his
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:46327:296"/> Grand-Father, died without Issue. He being dead, <hi>Socrates</hi> married <hi>Calisto,</hi> of whom he had his Son <hi>Symmachus.</hi> To him was born <hi>Aristonymus,</hi> to <hi>Aristonymus Charmides,</hi> who was the Father of <hi>Philippe.</hi> Of her and <hi>Lysander</hi> came <hi>Medius,</hi> who also was an Interpreter, one of the <hi>Eumolpides.</hi> He begat two Children of <hi>Timothea,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Glaucus,</hi> viz. <hi>Laodamia</hi> and <hi>Medius,</hi> who were Priests of <hi>Neptune Erectheus;</hi> also <hi>Philippae</hi> a Daughter, who was afterward Priestess of <hi>Minerva;</hi> for before, she was married to <hi>Diocles</hi> the <hi>Milettean,</hi> to whom she bare a Son named <hi>Diocles,</hi> who was a Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of a Regiment of Foot.

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis said, that he penn'd fifteen Orations. He was often Crown'd by the People, and had Statues dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. His Image in Brass was set up in <hi>Cerami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> by order of the Publick, in the time of <hi>Anaxicra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> in whose time also it was order'd that he and his eldest Son shou'd be provided for with Diet in <hi>Prytane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> and he being dead, <hi>Lycophron</hi> his eldest Son sued for that Donation. This <hi>Lycurgus</hi> also was used frequently to plead on the account of Sacred things; and accused <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolycus</hi> the <hi>Areopagite, Lysicles</hi> the Praetor, <hi>Demades</hi> the Son of <hi>Demius, Menesaechmus,</hi> and many others, all whom he caused to be condemned as guilty. <hi>Diphilus</hi> also was called in question by him, for impairing and diminishing the Props of the Metal Mines, and so unjustly making himself Rich, and caused him to be condemned to die, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Provision made by the Laws in that Case. He gave, out of his own Stock, fifty Drachms to every Citizen, the Sum-total of which Donation, amounted to one hundred and sixty Talents; but some
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:46327:296"/> say he gave a pound of Silver to each. He likewise accused <hi>Aristogiton, Cleocrates</hi> and <hi>Antolimus,</hi> for appearing as Free-men, when they were known to be but as it were Slaves. He was Sirnamed <hi>Lycurgus Ibis,</hi> which in English sounds, <hi>A black Stork:</hi> and they wou'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him to <hi>Xenophon Nycteris,</hi> which in plainer terms, is, <hi>Owl.</hi> His Ancestors derived their Pedigree from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectheus,</hi> the Son of the Earth and of <hi>Vuloan;</hi> but he was nearest to <hi>Lycomedes</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> whom the People honoured with publick Solemnities. There is a Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Race of the Priests of <hi>Neptune,</hi> in a compleat Table, which is placed in the Temple at <hi>Erectheium,</hi> drawn by <hi>Ismenias</hi> the <hi>Chalcidian:</hi> in the same place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so stood the Images of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and of his Son <hi>Abron, Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Lyciphron;</hi> and by them <hi>Timarchus</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisodotus</hi> the Son of <hi>Praxiteles.</hi> His Son <hi>Abron</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Table, and coming to the Priesthood by right of Scoession, he resigned to his Brother <hi>Lycophron,</hi> and hence he is painted as giving a Trident. But <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had made a Draught of all his Actions, and hung it on a Column before the Wrestling-Court built by himself, that all might read that wou'd; and no Man cou'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him of any Offence. He likewise referred to the People, the Crowning of <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and to dedicate Statues to him, because he had promised and undertaken to cover the Altar of <hi>Apollo</hi> in the Market with Gold, according to the Order of the Oracle.

Some say he was initiated by <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and they affirm that he more especially followed the last of these two. <hi>Hegesias</hi> the <hi>Magnesian</hi> writes, that he intreated his Master's Leave to go hear <hi>Callistratus</hi> the Son of <hi>Empaedus,</hi> an <hi>Amphidura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But <hi>Callistratus</hi> being some time after banished, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> being arrived to some years of maturity, he joyned with <hi>Isocrates</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi> After this, he took <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saeus</hi> into his House, and for the space of four years la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd very hard in imitation of his Orations.

When he came to Age, in the Year of <hi>Timocrates,</hi> he call'd his Tutors and Guardians to account for their Male-administration, in not allowing him what was fitting and requisite out of his Estate, while he was under their Tuition.

                  <pb n="575" facs="tcp:46327:297"/>
                  <p>When <hi>Aristophon,</hi> by reason of his Age, cou'd not hold the Government any longer, he was chosen Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager, or Overseer of the Dances.

                  <p>'Tis reported of him, that while he was a Youth, he confined himself to a Den or Cave, and there studied his Orations, and shaved half of his Head, that he might not be allured to divert himself from it; and that he lay upon a very narrow Bed, that he might awake and rise the sooner. And for that he cou'd not very well pronounce the Letter R. he accustomed himself very much to that, that he might master it if possible: and using likewise an unseemly Motion of his Shoulder when he spake at any time, he remedied that by a Spit, or, as some say, a Sword stuck in the Ceiling just over his Shoulder, that the Fear of being pricked with it might break him off that indecent Gesture. They report of him further, that when he cou'd declaim pretty well, that he had a sort of Looking-glass as big as himself, and used always in declaiming, to look in that, to the end he might see, and correct what was amiss. He used likewise at some certain times to go down to the <hi>Phalerian</hi> Shore, to the end, that being accustomed to the Surges, and Noise of the Waves, he might not be daunted by the Clamors of the People, when he shou'd at any time declaim in publick. And being naturally short winded, he gave <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> a Player, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Drachms to teach him to pronounce long Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in one Breath.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, betaking himself to the Affairs of the Common-wealth, and finding the People divided into two different Factions, one in favour of <hi>Philip,</hi> and the other standing for the Liberties and Properties of the
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:46327:298"/> People; he took part with them that opposed <hi>Philip,</hi> and always perswaded the Citizens to help those who were in danger and trouble by <hi>Philips</hi> Oppression; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his Companions in Council, <hi>Hyperides, Nausicles, Polyenctus</hi> aad <hi>Diotimus;</hi> and then he drew the <hi>Thebans, Euboeans, Corcyreans, Corinthians, Boeotians,</hi> and many more into a League with the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Being abroad one day, and his Memory failing him, his Oration was hiss'd; which made him return home very heavy and melancholly: and being met by <hi>Eunomus</hi> the <hi>Thriasian,</hi> an old Man, by him he was comforted and encouraged. But chiefly he was animated by <hi>Andronicus</hi> the Player, who told him that his Orations were excellent, but that he wanted something of Action. And so when he was asked what was the first part of Oratory, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>Action;</hi> and which was the second, he replied, <hi>Action;</hi> and which was the third, he still answered, <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Another time, declaiming publickly, and using Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions too youthful for one of his Years and Gravity, he was laugh'd at, and ridiculed by the <hi>Commedians, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphanes</hi> and <hi>Timocles,</hi> who in derision used to repeat such Phrases as these, as utter'd by him—

                     </q> For having sworn thus in presence of the People, he raised a Tumult about him.

                     <hi>Lamachus</hi> the <hi>Terinaean</hi> sound the Praises of <hi>Philip,</hi> and of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, his Son, and decry the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize of the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Olynthians,</hi> he stood up in their Defence against him, and from the ancient Poets he proclaim'd the great and noble Atchievments of the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Olynthians;</hi> and so elegantly he behaved himself in this Affair, that he at once silenced <hi>Lamachus,</hi> and made him convey himself immediately out of the Assembly. And even <hi>Philip</hi> himself, when he heard what an Harangue he made against him, replied, <hi>That, if he had heard him himself, he shou'd have been apt to commend him, and to have chosen him to make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself.</hi> He was used to compare <hi>Demosthenes</hi>'s Orations to Souldiers, for the Force they carried along with them: but the Orations of <hi>Isocrates</hi> to Fencers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Theatrical Delight that accompanied them.</p>
                  <p>Being about the Age of seven and thirty, reckoning from <hi>Dexitheus</hi> to <hi>Callimachus,</hi> in whose time the <hi>Olyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> sent to beg Aid of the <hi>Athenians</hi> against <hi>Philip,</hi> who then made War upon them, he perswaded them to answer the <hi>Olynthians</hi> Request: but in the following Year, in which <hi>Plato</hi> died, <hi>Philip</hi> overthrew and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the <hi>Olynthians. Xenophon</hi> also, the Scholar of <hi>Socrates,</hi> had some knowledge of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> either at his first Rise, or at least, when he was most famous and flourishing: For he wrote the Acts of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as touching what passed at the Battel of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> in the Year of <hi>Charicles:</hi> our <hi>Demosthenes</hi> having some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore overthrown his Guardians, in a Suit he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced against them, of which mention is made alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. When <hi>Aeschines,</hi> being condemn'd, fled toward <hi>Athens, Demosthenes</hi> hearing of it, he took Horse and rode after him; which <hi>Aeschines</hi> understanding, and fearing to be apprehended again, he came out to meet <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> and fell at his Feet, cover'd his Face, and
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:46327:299"/> begg'd his Mercy; upon which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> bid him stand up, assured him of his Favour, and as a Pledge of it, gave him a Talent of Silver. He advised the People to maintain a Company of mercenary Souldiers in <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos,</hi> and thither sail'd himself as Captain of the Galleys. Another time, being entrusted to buy Corn, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of defrauding the City, but cleared himself of the Accusation, and was acquitted. When <hi>Philip</hi> made War upon <hi>Elatia,</hi> and overcame it, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers went to the War of <hi>Caeronea,</hi> where he is said to have deserted his Colours, and flying away, a Bramble caught hold of his Vest behind, when turning about in hast, thinking an Enemy had overtaken him, he cry'd out, <hi>Save my Life, and say what shall be my Ranson.</hi> On his Buckler he had engraven for his Motto, <hi>Good Fortune.</hi> And it was he that made the Orations at the Funerals of such as died in the Field.</p>
                  <p>After these things, he bent his whole Care and Study for the reparation and adorning of the City and Walls; and besides what Money he expended of the City Stock, he laid out of his own Pocket at least an hundred pounds. And besides this, he gave ten thousand to those who were concern'd about things Sacred, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ship, he sail'd from Coast to Coast to collect Money of the Allies: for which he was often by <hi>Damoteles, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonicus,</hi> and <hi>Hyperides,</hi> crowned with golden Crowns: and afterwards by <hi>Ctesiphon.</hi> Which afterward had like to have been retracted, <hi>Diodotus</hi> and <hi>Aeschines</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove it to be contrary to the Laws; but he defended himself so well against their Allegations, that he overcame all Difficulties, his Enemies not having the fifth part of the Votes of the People.</p>
                  <p>After this, when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great made his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Harpalus</hi> fled to <hi>Athens</hi> with a great Sum of Money; at first he wou'd not let him be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd, but afterwards, he being landed, and having
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:46327:299"/> given him a thousand Daricks, he was of another Mind; and when the <hi>Athenians</hi> determin'd to deliver <hi>Harpalus</hi> up to <hi>Antipater,</hi> he oppos'd it, averring that the Money was laid up in the Cittadel, ordering the Sum to be declar'd to the People, and accordingly <hi>Harpalus</hi> told them, it was seven hundred and fifty Talents, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, according to <hi>Philochorus.</hi> But when <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus</hi> broke out of the Prison wherein he was kept till some Person shou'd come from <hi>Alexander,</hi> and was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd into <hi>Crete,</hi> or, as some will have it, into <hi>Taenarus</hi> in <hi>Laconia; Demosthenes</hi> was accused that he had let him go for a Sum of Money; and that he had not given a true Account of the Sum delivered to him; nor had he impeach'd the Negligence of the Keepers of both him and the Money; and so he was judicially cited by <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perides, Pytheus, Menesaechmus, Himereus</hi> and <hi>Patrocles,</hi> who prosecuted him so severely, as to cause him to be condemn'd in the Court of <hi>Areopagus;</hi> and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, he went into Exile, not being able to pay five fold; for he was accus'd of receiving thirty Talents: Others say, that he wou'd not run the Risque of a Tryal, but went into Banishment befor the Day came. After this Tempest was over, when the <hi>Athenians</hi> sent <hi>Polyeuctus</hi> to the Republick of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> to draw them off from the Alliance of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he not succeeding, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> appear'd to second him, where he reason'd so effectually, that he easily prevail'd. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd him so much Credit and Esteem, that after some time a Galley was dispatch'd to call him Home again. And the <hi>Athenians</hi> decreed, that whereas he ow'd the State thirty Talents, as a Fine laid on him for the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor he was accused of, he shou'd be excus'd only for building an Altar to <hi>Jupiter Servator</hi> in the <hi>Piraeeum:</hi> which Decree was first propos'd by <hi>Damon</hi> his near Kinsman.</p>
                  <pb n="580" facs="tcp:46327:300"/>
                  <p>This being agreed on, he return'd to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Affairs in the Common-wealth again. But when <hi>Antipater</hi> was block'd up in <hi>Lamia,</hi> and the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> offer'd Sacrifices for the happy News, he happen'd, being talking with <hi>Agesistratus,</hi> one of his intimate Friends, to say, that his Judgment concerning the State of Affairs, did not jump with other Mens, for that he knew the <hi>Greeks</hi> were brisk and ready enough for a short Encounter, but were not able to endure a lasting War. When <hi>Antipater</hi> had taken <hi>Pharsales,</hi> and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to besiege <hi>Athens</hi> it self, if they refus'd to deliver up such Orators as had declaim'd against him: <hi>Demosthenes</hi> suspecting himself to be one of the Number, left the City, and fled first into <hi>Egina,</hi> that he might take Sanctuary in the Temple of <hi>Aeacus;</hi> but being afraid to trust himself long there, he went over to <hi>Calauria:</hi> and when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had decreed to deliver up those Orators, and him especially as one of them, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a Suppliant in the Temple of <hi>Neptune.</hi> When <hi>Archias,</hi> who from his Office of pursuing Fugitives, was call'd <hi>Phygatotheres,</hi> came thither, who was the Scholar of <hi>Anaximenes</hi> the Orator; when he, I say, came to him, and perswaded him to go with him, telling him, that no doubt he shou'd be receiv'd by <hi>Antipater</hi> as a Friend; he reply'd, <hi>When you play a part in a Tragedy, you cannot perswade me to believe you the Person you represent; no more shall you now perswade me by your Counsel.</hi> And when <hi>Archias</hi> endeavour'd to force him thence, the Towns-men wou'd not suffer it. And <hi>Demosthenes</hi> told them, that he did not flee to <hi>Calabria</hi> to save his Life, but that he might convice the <hi>Macedonians</hi> of their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence committed, even against the Gods themselves. And with that he call'd for a Writing-Table, and if we may credit <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Magnesian,</hi> on that he wrote this Distich, which afterwards the <hi>Athenians</hi> caus'd to be affix'd to his Statue; and 'twas to this purpose:

                     </q> This Statue, made by <hi>Polyeuctus,</hi> is plac'd near the Cloister, where the Altar of the twelve Gods is erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Some say this Writing was found; <hi>Demosthenes</hi> to <hi>Antipater</hi> Greeting. <hi>Philochorus</hi> tells us that he died by drinking of Poyson; but <hi>Satyrus</hi> the Historiographer will have it, that the Pen was poison'd with which he wrote his Epistle, and putting it into his Mouth, soon after he tasted it he died. <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> is of another O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that being in continual Fear of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> he wore a poison'd Bracelet on his Arm. Others say again, that he died with holding his Breath; and others, lastly, say, that he carry'd strong Poyson in his Signet ** two and twenty.</p>
                  <p>When King <hi>Philip</hi> was dead, he appear'd publickly in a glorious Robe or Mantle, as rejoycing for his Death, though he but just before mourn'd for his Daughter. He assisted the <hi>Thebans</hi> likewise against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> and animated all the other <hi>Greeks.</hi> So that when <hi>Alexander</hi> had conquer'd <hi>Thebes,</hi> he demanded <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> threatning them, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to deliver him. When he went against <hi>Persia,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Ships of the <hi>Athenians, Demosthenes</hi> oppos'd it, saying, <hi>Who can assure us, that he will not use those Ships we shou'd send him, against our selves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He left behind him two Sons by one Wife, the Daughter of one <hi>Heliodorus Eudocimus.</hi> He had but one Daughter, who died unmarried, being but a Child. A Sister, too, he had, who married with <hi>Laches</hi> the <hi>Leuconian,</hi> his Kinsman, and to him bore <hi>Demochares,</hi> who prov'd inferior to none in his time for Eloquence, Conduct and Courage. His Statue is still standing in
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:46327:301"/> the <hi>Pritaneum,</hi> on the Right of the Entry, the first that ever was cloathed with a Coat, and girt with a Sword; because in this Habit he delivered an Oration to the People when <hi>Antipater</hi> demanded of them their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, in process of time, the <hi>Athenians</hi> decreed Nourishment to be given to the Kindred of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in the <hi>Prytaneum;</hi> and likewise set up a Statue to his Memory, when he was dead, in the Market, in the Year of <hi>Gorgias:</hi> Which Honours were paid him at the Request of <hi>Demochares</hi> his Sisters Son. And ten years after, <hi>Laches,</hi> the Son of <hi>Demochares</hi> a <hi>Leuconian,</hi> in the Year of <hi>Pytharatus,</hi> requir'd the same Honour for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; <hi>viz.</hi> That his Statue shou'd be set up in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and that both he and his Posterity, that is, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of his Line for the future shou'd have their Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the <hi>Prytaneum,</hi> and the highest room at all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Shews and Triumphs. These Decrees concerning both of them, are engross'd, and to be found among the Statute Laws. The Statue of <hi>Demochares,</hi> as we have said before, was afterwards remov'd out of the Market into the Prytaneum.</p>
                  <p>There are extant sixty five Orations which are truly his. Some report of him, that he liv'd a very dissolute and vitious Life, appearing often in Womens Apparel, and being frequently conversant at Masks and Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; whence he was sirnam'd <hi>Batalus:</hi> though others say, that this was a Diminutive of his Nurses Name, and that from her he was call'd <hi>Batalus</hi> in derision. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> who for his churlish Humor, was sirnamed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> a Dog, espying him one day in a Victualing-house, he was very much ashamed, and to shun him, went to withdraw: But <hi>Diogenes</hi> call'd after him, and told him: <hi>The more you shrink inward, the more you will be in.</hi> The same <hi>Diogenes</hi> hearing him once upon the Banter, said of him, that in his Orations, he was a <hi>Scythian,</hi> a robust,

When once at a Meeting of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they wou'd not suffer him to speak, he told them, he had but a short Story to tell them. Upon which all being silent, thus he began; <hi>A certain Youth,</hi> said he, <hi>hired an Ass in Summer time, from hence to</hi> Megara. <hi>About Noon, when the Sun was very hot, and both he that hired the Ass, and the owner being desirous of sitting under, or on one side of the Ass, that he might shade them, they each thrust the other away, the Owner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, that he let him only his Ass, and not the Shadow; and the other replying, that since he had hir'd the Ass, all that belong'd to him was at his Dispose.</hi> Having said thus, he seem'd to go his way. But the <hi>Athenians</hi> willing now to hear his Story out, call'd him back, and desired him to proceed. To whom he reply'd; <hi>How comes it to pass, that ye are so desirous of hearing a Story of the Shadow of an Ass, and refuse to give ear to Matters of greater Moment? Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> the Player, boasting to him, that he had gotten a whole Talent by playing but two days, he answer'd, <hi>And I have gotten five Talents by being silent but one Day.</hi> One Day his Voice failing him, when he was declaiming publickly, being hiss'd, he cry'd out to the People, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ye are to judge of Players, indeed, by the Clearness and Tuneableness of their Voice; but of Orators, by the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Excellency of their Sentences.

                  <p>
                     <hi>HYperides</hi> was Son of <hi>Glausippus,</hi> and Grand-son of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> of the Borough of <hi>Colittea.</hi> He had a Son who bare the same Name with his Father <hi>Glaucip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put</hi> the Orator, who wrote many Orations, and begat a Son named <hi>Alphinus.</hi> He was <hi>Plato</hi>'s Scholar, and had the Management of publick Affairs with <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or, as some will have it, he was the Scholar of <hi>Plato, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> and <hi>Isocrates:</hi> However, his Concern in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, was at that time, when <hi>Alexander</hi> accosted <hi>Greece,</hi> whom he vigorously oppos'd, in his Demands of Officers and Ships of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> He advised the People not to discharge the Garison of <hi>Taenara;</hi> and this he seem'd to do for the Sake of a Friend of his, who was Commander of it. At first he used to plead Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for a Fee, and was suspected to have receiv'd part of
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:46327:302"/> the Money which <hi>Ephialtes</hi> brought out of <hi>Persia.</hi> When <hi>Philip</hi> besieged the City <hi>Bizantium,</hi> he was sent as Captain of the Galleys for the Assistance and Relief of that City. In that Year he had the Charge and Care of the solemn Dances, when others were dismiss'd from all publick Offices. He obtain'd a Decree for some Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to be paid to <hi>Demosthenes;</hi> and when that Decree was repeal'd at the Instance of <hi>Diondas,</hi> as being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Laws, he being call'd in question upon it, clear'd himself. He did not continue his Friendship with <hi>Demosthenes, Lysicles,</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to the last; for, <hi>Lysicles</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> being dead, and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> being accus'd of having receiv'd Money of <hi>Harpalus,</hi> he, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the rest, was pitch'd upon as the only Person who was not corrupted with Bribery, to draw up his Indictment, which he accordingly did. Being once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of publishing Acts contrary to the Laws; as, that all Inhabitants of <hi>Athens</hi> shou'd be accounted Citizens; that Slaves shou'd be made free; that, all sacred things, Children and Women, shou'd be confin'd to the <hi>Piraee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> he clear'd himself of all, and was acquitted. And being blam'd by some, who wondred how he cou'd be ignorant of the many Laws that were directly repugnant to those Decrees; he answer'd, that, <hi>The Arms of the</hi> Macedonians <hi>dazled his Sight, and it was not he, but the Battel of</hi> Chaeronea <hi>that made that Decree.</hi> But <hi>Philip</hi> being affrighed at somewhat, gave leave to carry away their Dead out of the Field, which before he had deny'd to the Heraulds of <hi>Lebadia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, at the Overthrow at <hi>Cranon,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Antipater,</hi> and the People being resolv'd to deliver him up, he fled out of the City with others who were under the same Condemnation, to <hi>Aegina:</hi> where meeting with <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> he excused himself for the Breach of Friendship between them. Going from thence, he was apprehended by <hi>Archias,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Phygadotheres,</hi>
                     <pb n="586" facs="tcp:46327:303"/> by Country a <hi>Thurian,</hi> formerly a Player, but at that time in the Service of <hi>Antipater;</hi> by this Man, I say, he was apprehended, even in the very Temple of <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> though he grasp'd the Image of that God in, his Arms, and was brought before <hi>Antipater,</hi> who was then at <hi>Corinth.</hi> Where being put upon the Rack, he bit out his Tongue, because he wou'd not divulge the, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his Country, and so died, on, or about the ninth Day of <hi>October. Hermippus</hi> tells us, that as he went into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> his Tongue was cut out, and his Body cast out unburied; but <hi>Alphinus</hi> his Cousin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or, according to the Opinion of others, his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by his Son <hi>Glausippus,</hi> obtain'd Leave, by means of one <hi>Philopithes</hi> a Physician, to take up his Body, which he burnt, and carried the Ashes to <hi>Athens</hi> to his Kinsfolk there, contrary to the Edicts both of the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians:</hi> which not only banish'd them, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise forbad the Burial of them any where in their own Country. Others say, that he went to <hi>Cleonae,</hi> where with others he died; having his Tongue cut out, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. However, his Relations and Friends took his Bones when his Body was burnt, and buried them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Ancestors before the Gate <hi>Hippades,</hi> as <hi>Heliodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> gives us the Relation in his third Book <hi>Of Monuments.</hi> His Monument is now altogether unknown and lost, being thrown down with Age and long standing.</p>
                  <p>He is said to have excell'd all others in his way of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himself in his Orations to the People. And there are some, who prefer him even to <hi>Demosthenes</hi> himself. There are seventy seven Orations which bear his Name, of which only two and fifty are genuine, and truly his. He was much given to Venery, insomuch, that he turn'd his Son out of Doors, to entertain that famous Curtesan, <hi>Murrhina:</hi> In <hi>Pyraeeum</hi> he had another, whose Name was <hi>Aristagora;</hi> and at <hi>Eleusine,</hi> where the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of his Estate lay; he kept another, one <hi>Philete,</hi> a
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:46327:303"/>
                     <hi>Theban,</hi> whom he purchased for twenty Pounds. His usual Walk was in the Fish-Market. It is thought that he was accus'd of Impiety with one <hi>Phryne,</hi> a <hi>Curtezan</hi> likewise, and so was sought after to be apprehended, as he himself seems to intimate in the beginning of an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and 'tis said, that when Sentence was just ready to be pass'd upon her, he produc'd her in Court, open'd he Cloaths before, and discover'd her naked Breasts, which were so very white, that for her Beauty's sake, the Judges for that time acquitted her. He at leisure times drew up several Declamations against <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> which he thus discover'd; <hi>Hyperides</hi> being sick, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> came one Day to visit him, and caught him with a Book in his Hand written against him; at which seeming somewhat displeas'd, <hi>Hyperides</hi> told him; <hi>This Book shall hurt no Man that is my Friend; but as a Curb it may serve to restrain my Enemy from offering me any Injury.</hi> He obtain'd a Decree of some Honours to be paid to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> who gave the poyson'd Cup to <hi>Alexander.</hi> He joyn'd with <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in fomenting the <hi>Lamian</hi> War, and made an admirable Oration at the Funerals of those who lost their Lives therein.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> embark'd for <hi>Eubaea,</hi> and the <hi>Athenians</hi> were at the News of it in no little Consternation; <hi>Hype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> in a very short time, by the voluntary Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Citizens, fitted out forty Sail: and was the first that set the Example, by setting out two Gallies, one for himself, and another for his Son, at his own Charge.</p>
                  <p>When there was a Controversie between the <hi>Delians</hi> and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who shou'd have the Preheminence in the Temple at <hi>Delos: Aeschines</hi> being chosen on the behalf of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the <hi>Areopagites</hi> pitch'd upon <hi>Hype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> for their Advocate, and his Oration is yet extant, and bears the Name of the <hi>Deliack</hi> Oration.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is said of him, that he never affected much Action in his Orations to the People; his chief aim being to lay down the Matter as plainly, and make the Case as obvious to the Judges as he cou'd.</p>
                  <p>He was sent likewise to the <hi>Elians,</hi> to plead the Cause of <hi>Callippus</hi> the Fencer, who was accus'd of carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Prize at the publick Games unfairly: in which Cause he got the better. But when he oppos'd the Sentence of paying Honours to <hi>Phocion,</hi> obtain'd by <hi>Midias</hi> the Son of <hi>Midias</hi> the <hi>Anagyrasian,</hi> he was in that Cause overthrown. This appear'd on the twenty fourth, or, as some suppose, the twenty seventh Day of <hi>May,</hi> in the Year when <hi>Xenus</hi> was Governor.</p>

He was frequently conversant with <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Phalerian</hi> too. He betook himself more especially to the Affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, after the Death of <hi>Antipater,</hi> when some of the Orators were kill'd, others banish'd. Having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Friendship with <hi>Cassander,</hi> he became in a short time vastly Rich, by exacting great Rates for his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of those for whom he wrote them. He oppos'd himself to the greatest and most noble Orators of his time, not by being over forward to declaim publickly,
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:46327:304"/> for his Faculty did not lye that way, but by composing Orations for their Adversaries. And when <hi>Harpalus</hi> had broken out of Prison, he wrote several Orations, which he gave to their Accusers to pronounce against those that were suspected to have taken Bribes of him.</p>
                  <p>Some time after, being accused of a Conspiracy with <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Cassander,</hi> about the Matter of <hi>Munichia,</hi> when it was surpriz'd by <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who put a Garison into it, in the Year when <hi>Anaxicrates</hi> was Governour, he turn'd the greatest part of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state into Money, and fled to <hi>Calchis,</hi> where he liv'd in Exile about fifteen Years, where he increas'd his Stock, and afterwards, by the Mediation of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> he and some other banish'd Persons, return'd to <hi>Athens.</hi> Then he took up his Abode in the House of one <hi>Proxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> his intimate Friend; where, being very Aged, and withal dim Sighted, he lost his Gold.

               <p>WE are not ignorant, O <hi>Euphanes,</hi> that you, being a [frequent] Extoller of the [Poet] <hi>Pindar,</hi> have often in your Mouth [this Saying of his,] as a thing, well, and to the purpose spoken by him:
<q>
                     <l>When as the Combat's once agreed,</l>
                     <l>Who by Pretence seeks to be freed,</l>
                     <l>Obscures his Vertue quite.</l>
                  </q> But since Sloth and Effeminacy [or want of Courage] towards [the Management of] Civil Affairs, having many Pretences, do for the last, as if it were drawn from the Sacred Line, tender to us old Age, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this chiefly to abate and cool our honorable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, alledge, that there is a certain [fitting and] decent Dissolution, not only of the Athletical, but also of the Political Period, [or that there is in the Revolution of
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:46327:308"/> our Years, a certain set and limited time, after which 'tis no more proper for us to employ our selves in the Conduct of the State, than in the Corporeal and robust Exercises of Youth. I esteem my self obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate also to you those Sentiments of mine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old Mens intermedling with publick Matters, which I am ever and anon ruminating on by my self: so that neither of us may desert that long Course, we have to this Day held together, nor rejecting the Political Life, [which has been] as it were an intimate Friend of our own Years, [growing all along up with us,] change it for another, to which we are [absolute] Strangers, and with which we have not time to become acquainted and familiar; but that we may persist in what we had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, [and have been inur'd to] from the Beginning, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same Conclusion to our Life, and our Living honorably; unless we would by the short [Space of Life,] we have remaining, disgrace that longer Time, [we have already liv'd,] as having been spent idly, and in nothing, [that is] commendable. For Tyranny is not an honorable Sepulchre, as one [heretofore] told <hi>Dionysius,</hi> whose Monarchy, [obtain'd by, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred] with Injustice, did by its Non-cessation [and long Continuance,] bring on him but a more perfect Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; as <hi>Diogenes</hi> afterwards let his Son know, when seeing him at <hi>Corinth,</hi> of a Tyrant become a private Person, he said to him: <hi>How unworthy of thy self,</hi> Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, <hi>thou actest! For thou oughtst not to live here at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fearless with us, but to spend thy Life, as thy Father did, even to old Age, immur'd within a Tyrannical Fortress.</hi> But the popular and legal Government of a Man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd to shew himself no less profitable in obeying, than in commanding, is an honorable Monument, which really adds to Death the Glory, accrewing from Life. <hi>For this thing,</hi> as <hi>Simonides</hi> says, <hi>goes last under the Ground:</hi> unless [it be in those,] in whom Humanity, and the
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:46327:308"/> Love of Honour dies first, and whose Zeal for Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sooner decays, than their Covetousness after Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Necessaries; as if the Soul had its active and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Parts weaker than those, that are passive and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real: which 'twere neither honest to say, nor yet to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit from those, who say [it, and affirm,] that only of Gaining we are never weary. But we ought to a better purpose to produce the Saying of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> that not the Desire of Honour alone never grows old, but much more also the Inclination to Society and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the State, which continues even in Ants and Bees to the very last. For never did any one know a Bee to become by Age a Drone, as some think it requisite of States-men, [of whom they expect,] that, when the Vigor of their Youth is past, they should retire, and sit mouldy at Home, suffering their active Vertue to be consum'd [and eaten up] by Idleness, as Iron is by Rust. For <hi>Cato</hi> [indeed excellently well] said, that we ought not willingly to add the Shame, [proceeding] from Vice, to those many Afflictions, which Old Age has of its own. For of the many Vices, [every where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding,] there is none, which more disgraces an old Man, than Sloth, Delicacy, and Effeminateness, when [retiring] from the Court and Council, he mues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up at Home like a Woman, or [getting into the Country, oversees his Reapers and Gleaners: [for of such an one we may say with <hi>Sophocles:</hi>]
<q>Where's <hi>Oedipus,</hi> and all his famous Riddles?</q>
               </p>
               <p>For as for him, who shou'd in his old Age, and not before, begin to meddle with publick Matters, (as they say of <hi>Epimenides,</hi> that having faln asleep, [while he was] a young Man, he awaken'd [not till] fifty years after, [when he was] grown old) and shaking off so long and so close-sticking a Repose, should thrust himself,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:46327:309"/> being unaccustom'd and unexercis'd into difficult and laborious Employs, without having been experienc'd in Civil affairs, or [inur'd to the Conversations] of Men, [such a Man] may perhaps give [occasion] to one, that wou'd reprehend him, to say with the [Prophetess] <hi>Pythia,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>If that thou seek'st to govern in the State,</l>
                     <l>And rule the People, Friend, thou com'st too late,</l>
                     <l>And at an hour unfit, knock'st at the Palace Gate.</l>
                  </q> Like an ill-bred Guest, coming late to a Banquet, or a Stranger, [looking in the Dead of the Night for a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,] thou wouldst change, not thy Place, or Region, but thy Life [for one,] of which thou hast made no Tryal. For that Saying of <hi>Simonides.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>—The State instructs a Man,</q>
               <p>is true in those, who [apply themselves to the Business of the Common-weal, whilst] they have yet time to be taught, and learn a Science, which is scarce attain'd with much Labour through many Struglings and Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even when it timely meets with a Nature, that can easily undergo Toil and Difficulty. These things seem not to be impertinently spoken against him, who in his old Age begins to act in the Management of the State. And yet on the contrary we see, how young Men, and those of unripe Years, are by Persons of [great] Judgment diverted from medling in publick Matters: and the Laws [also] testifie the same, when by the Cries in the Assemblies they summon not first the <hi>Alcibiadae</hi> and the <hi>Pytheae</hi> to come to the Desk, but those, who have pass'd the Age of fifty years, to make Speeches, and consult together [for the Good of the People.] For the being unus'd to Boldness, the want
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:46327:309"/> of Experience, and the first Heat is not to every Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier so **
<q>Here is a Defect in the Original.</q> But <hi>Cato,</hi> when [at the Age of] above eighty years, he was to plead his own Cause said, <hi>That 'tis a difficult thing for a Man to make his Apology, [and justifie his Life] before others, than those, with whom he has liv'd [and been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Men indeed confess, that the Actions of <hi>[Augustus] Caesar,</hi> when he had defeated <hi>Anthony,</hi> were no less Royal, and useful to the Publick, towards the End of his Life, [than any he had done before.] And himself severely reprehending [the Dissoluteness of] young Men by [e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing Good] Customs and Laws, when they were in an Uproar, [only] said to them: <hi>Young Men, [refuse not to] hear an old Man, to whom old Men [not unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] gave Ear, when he was young.</hi> The Government al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of <hi>Pericles</hi> exerted it self with most Vigor in his old Age, when he both perswaded the <hi>Athenians</hi> to make War, and at another time, when they were eagerly bent unseasonably to [go forth, and] fight sixty thousand armed Men, withstood, and hindred them, sealing up in a manner the Arms of the People, and the Keys of the Gates. Now as for what <hi>Xenophon</hi> has written of <hi>Agesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> 'tis fit it should be set down in his own Words. <hi>What Youth,</hi> says he, <hi>[ever] was there, than which his old Age did not appear gallanter? Who was [ever] so terrible to his Enemies in the very Flower of his Virility, as</hi> Agesilaus <hi>in the De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

At whose Death were Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries [over seen] more joyful, than at that of</hi> Agesilaus, <hi>though he departed [not this Life, till] stooping under the Burthen of his Years? Who more [encourag'd and] emboldned his Confederates, than</hi> Agesilaus, <hi>though being at the utmost Period of his Life? What young Man was [ever] miss'd
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:46327:310"/> more by his Friends, than</hi> Agesilaus, <hi>who dy'd not till he was very old?</hi> Age then hindred not these Men from performing such [gallant] Actions; and yet we, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, being at our Ease in States, which neither have Tyranny, War, nor Siege, [to molest them,] are afraid of [being troubled with] such bloodless Debates and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations, as are for the most part terminated with Justice only by Law, and Words, confessing our selves by this not only worse than those ancient Generals and States-men, but even than Poets, Sophisters and Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Since <hi>Simonides</hi> in his old Age gain'd the Victory in [composing of Songs for] Dances, as the Epigram testifies in these concluding Verses:
<q>
                     <l>Fourscore years old was <hi>Leoprepes</hi> Son</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Simonides,</hi> when he this Glory won.</l>
                  </q> And 'tis said of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> that, to avoid being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd of Dotage [at the Instance] of his Children, be repeated the Entrance of the <hi>Chorus</hi> in [his Tragedy of] <hi>Oedipus</hi> in <hi>Colonus,</hi> which begins thus:
<q>
                     <l>Welcome, Stranger, come in time</l>
                     <l>To the best place of this Clime,</l>
                     <l>White <hi>Colonus,</hi> which abounds</l>
                     <l>With brave Horses. In these Grounds,</l>
                     <l>Spread with Natures choicest Green,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Philomel</hi> is often seen.</l>
                     <l>Here She her Hearers charms with sweetest Laies,</l>
                     <l>Whilst with shrill Throat,</l>

                     <l>She moans the sad Misfortunes of her former Days.</l>
                  </q> And that, this Song appearing admirable he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd from the Court, as from the Theatre, with the Applause and Aco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mations of all that were present.
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:46327:310"/> And this short Verse is acknowledged to be of him:
<q>
                     <l>When <hi>Sophocles</hi> fram'd for <hi>Herodotus</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>This Ode, his Years were fifty five—</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Philemon</hi> also the <hi>Comedian,</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> were snatch'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Death, whilst they were acting on the Stage, and crown'd with Garlands. And as for <hi>Polus</hi> the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaedians, Eratosthenes</hi> and <hi>Philochorus</hi> related of him, that, being seventy years of Age, he a little before his Death, acted in four Days eight Tragedies.</p>
               <p>Is it not then a Shame, that those, who have grown old in Councils and Courts of Judicature, should appear less generous than such, as have spent their Years on the Stage, and forsaking those Exercises, which are really sacred, cast off the Person of the States-man, to put on instead of it, I know not what other. For to descend from the State of a Prince, to that of a Plow-man, is all over base and mean. For since <hi>Demosthenes</hi> says, that the <hi>Paralus,</hi> being a sacred Galley, was unworthily us'd [in being employ'd] to carry Timber, Pales, and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to <hi>Meidias:</hi> would not a Man, who should after his having quitted the Office of Superintendent at the publick Solemnities, Governour of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> or President in the Councel of the <hi>Amphictyons,</hi> be seen measuring of Corn, weighing of Raisins, and bargaining about Flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Wooll-Fells? Would not such an one, I say, wholly seem to have brought on himself, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb has it, the old Age of an Horse, without any ones necessitating him to it? For to set ones self to Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Employments and Trafficking, after one has born Office in the State, is the same, as if one should strip a wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But if (which is [the only thing] remaining) they shall by giving Effeminacies and Voluptuousness the Name of living at Quiet, and enjoying ones self, exhort a Statesman leisurely to wast away and grow old in them, I know not, to which of the two shameful Pictures his Life will seem to have the greater Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance: whether to the Mariners, who, leaving their Ship, not in the Harbor, but under Sail [in the open Sea,] spend all the Remainder of their Time in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Feasts of <hi>Venus;</hi> or to <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom, as some [Painters] merrily, [but yet ridiculously and] irreverently, represent wearing in <hi>Omphales</hi> Palace a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Petticoat, and giving himself up to be boxt and comb'd by the <hi>Lydian</hi> Damsels: so we, stripping a Statesman of his Lions Skin, [or of that Magnanimity and Courage, which renders him profitable to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,] and seating him at a [luxurious] Table, will there be always cloying his Palate with Delicacies, and filling his Ears with [effeminate] Songs and Musick: being not a whit asham'd [or put to the blush] by the Saying of <hi>Pompeius Magnus</hi> to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who having after his publick Services both in Camp and Council addicted himself to Bathing, Feasting, Conversing with Women in the Day, and much other Dissoluteness, even to the raising [and extravagantly furnishing] of sumptuous Buildings, fitter for Men of younger Years, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding <hi>Pompey</hi> with an Ambition and Desire of Rule, unsuitable to his Age, was by him answered: That it was more mis-becoming an old Man to live voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than to govern.

<pb n="603" facs="tcp:46327:311"/> Cannot</hi> Pompey <hi>live, unless</hi> Lucullus <hi>be Luxurious?</hi> For though Nature seeks by all means to delight and rejoyce her self, yet the Bodies of old Men are incapacitated for [the enjoying] any Pleasures, except a few, that are [absolutely] necessary [for the Preservation of their Lives.] For not only
<q>
                     <hi>Venus</hi> to old Men is averse,—</q> As <hi>Euripides</hi> has it; but their Appetite also to their Meat and Drink is for the most part dull, and as one would say, toothless; so that they have but little Gust and Relish in them.</p>
               <p>They ought therefore to furnish themselves with Pleasures of the Mind, not ungenerous or illiberal, as <hi>Simonides</hi> said to those, who reproach'd him with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, that being by his Years depriv'd of other Pleasures, he recreated his Old Age with the only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, he took in heaping up Riches. But [the Political Life, or] the Management of the Common-wealth has in it Pleasures exceeding great, and no less honorable; [being such,] as 'tis probable the [very] Gods do only, or [at least] chiefly enjoy themselves in: and these are [the Delights] which proceed from doing good, [or being beneficial to many,] and performing what is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, [and laudable.] For if <hi>Nicias</hi> the Painter took such Pleasure in the Work of his Hands, that he often [so far forgat himself, as that he] was fain to ask his Servants, whether he had Washt, or din'd; and if <hi>Archimedes</hi> was so intent upon the Table, [in which he drew his Geometrical Figures,] that his Attendants were oblig'd by force to pluck him from it, and strip him of his Clothes, that they might anoint him, whilst he [in the mean time] drew new Schemes on his anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body; and if <hi>Canus</hi> the Piper, whom you also know, was wont to say, that Men knew not how much more
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:46327:312"/> he delighted himself with his Playing, than he did others: for that then his Hearers would rather demand of him, than give him a Reward: do we not thence conceive, how great Pleasures the Vertues afford to those, who practice them, from their honest Actions, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-spirited Works, tending to the Benefit of Human Society? not tickling or stroaking, as do such sweet and gentle Motions as are made on the Flesh: for these indeed have a furious and unconstant Itching, mixt with a feavorish Inflammation; whereas those do by such gallant Actions, as he, who rightly administers the State, is Worker of, not with the golden Plumes of <hi>Euripides,</hi> but with those Coelestial Wings of <hi>Plato,</hi> elevate the Soul, which has receiv'd a Greatness of Courage and Wisdom, [accompany'd] with Joy. Call to mind [a little, I intreat you,] those things, you have so often heard. For <hi>Epaminondas</hi> indeed, being ask'd, what was the most pleasant thing that ever befel him, answer'd: His having gain'd the Victory at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> whilst his Father and Mother were yet living. And <hi>Sylla,</hi> when having freed <hi>Italy</hi> from Civil Wars, he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> could not the first Night fetch the least Wink of Sleep, having his Soul transported with excessive Joy and Content, as with a strong and mighty Wind▪ and this he himself has written in his <hi>Commentaries.</hi> For be it indeed so, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> says, that there is no Sound more pleasing [to the Ear,] than [the hearing ones own] Praises: there is also no Sight, Remembrance or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, which gives [a Man] so much Satisfaction, as the Contemplation of his own Actions, [perform'd by him] in [Offices of] Magistracy, and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State, as in eminent and publick Places.</p>
               <p>'Tis moreover true, that the courteous [and amiable] Thanks, [attending as] a Witness on [such vertuous] Acts, and the emulous Praise, [conferr'd on them,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:46327:312"/> which is as] a Guide, [conducting us in the Way] of just Benevolence, add a certain Lustre and shining Gloss to the Joy, [proceeding] of Vertue. Neither ought a Man negligently to suffer his Glory to wither in his old Age like a Wrestlers Garland; but, by adding always some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new and fresh to awaken, meliorate, and confirm the Grace of his former [Actions.] For as those Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, on whom was incumbent the Charge of [maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and] keeping in repair the <hi>Delian</hi> Ship [or Gallion,] by supplying, and putting into the Place of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd [Planks and Timber,] others, [that were new and sound,] seem'd to have preserv'd it from ancient times, [as if it were] eternal and incorruptible: so the preserving [and upholding] of ones Glory, is as the keeping in of a Fire, [a Work] of no difficulty, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring only [to be supply'd with] a little Fewel; but when either of them is wholly extinct and suppress'd, one cannot without great [Toil and] Labour [revive and] rekindle it again. <hi>Lampis,</hi> the Sea Commander, being ask'd, how he got his Wealth, answer'd: <hi>My greatest [Estate I gain'd] easily enough, but the smaller slowly and with much Labor.</hi> In like manner 'tis not easie at the beginning to acquire Reputation and Power in the State; but to augment and conserve it, when it is grown great, is not at all hard for those who have obtain'd it. For neither does a Friend, when he is once had, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire many and great Services, that he may so continue; but Assiduity does by small Signs [and Testimonies of Love] preserve his good Will: nor does the Friendship and Confidence of the People expect to have a Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bestowing Largesses, defending their Causes, or executing of Magistracy; but is maintain'd by a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and a not leaving, or being weary of Carefulness and Sollicitude for the Publick. For even Wars themselvs have not always Conflicts, Fights and Sieges; but there sometimes intervene Sacrifices, and Parleys, and [Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:46327:313"/> affording] bloodless Leisure for Sports and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
               <p>Whence then comes it, that the Administration of the Common-wealth should be fear'd, as inconsolable, laborious, and unsupportable, where Theatres, Processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Largesses, Musick, Joy, and at every turn the Service and Festival of some God or other, unbending the Brows, [and dissipating the Cares] of every Council and Senate, yield a manifold Pleasure and Delight? As for Envy, which is the greatest Evil attending the Management of publick Affairs, it least attacks old Age. For Dogs indeed, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> has it, bark at [a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,] whom they do not know; and Envy opposes him, who governs, at the very Door, as it were, of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, hindring his Access [and Entrance;] but meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bears an accustom'd and familiar Glory, and not churlishly or difficultly. Wherefore some resemble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to Smoak: For it arises thick at first, when the Fire begins to burn; but when it grows clear, it vanishes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Now Men usually quarrel and contend about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Excellencies, as Vertue, Nobility, and Honour, as if [they were of Opinion, that] they took from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as much as they give to others; but the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Time, which is properly call'd by the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, [or the Honour of old Age,] is free from Jealousie, and willingly granted [by Men to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.] For to no Honour is it so incident more to grace the Honorer, than the Honor'd, as to that, which is given to Persons in Years. Moreover, all Men do not expect to gain themselves Authority from Wealth, Eloquence, or Wisdom; but as for the Reverence and Glory, to which old Age [usually] brings Men, there is not any one of those, who act in the Management of the State, but hopes to attain it.</p>
               <p>He therefore, who having a long time contended [and born up,] against Envy, shall, when it ceases, and is
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:46327:313"/> appeas'd, withdraw himself from the State, and together with publick Actions desert Communities and Societies, differs nothing from that Pilot, who, having kept his Ship out at Sea, when in danger of being overwhelm'd by contrary [and tempestuous] Waves and Wind, seeks to put into Harbor, as soon as ever the Weather is grown calm and favorable. For the longer time there has been, the more Friends and Companions he has made, all which he can neither carry out with him, as a Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Master does his Quire, nor is it just to leave them. But as 'tis not easie to root up old Trees, [so neither is it to extirpate] a long continu'd Practice in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State, which, having many Roots, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in Affairs, which create more Troubles and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to those, who retire [from them,] than who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue [in them.] And if there is any remainder of Envy and Emulation against old Men from [former] Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about Civil Affairs, they should rather extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it by Authority, than turn their Backs on it, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away naked and disarm'd. For envious Persons do not so much assail those, who contend against them, as they do by Contempt insult over such, as retire. And to this bears Witness that Saying of the great <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> when in the Winter the <hi>Arcadians</hi> requested them to come into their City, and dwell in their Houses; for he would not permit it, but said to them: <hi>Now the</hi> Arcadians <hi>admire you, seeing you exercise your selves, and wrestle in your Armor; but if they shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you sitting by the Fire, and pounding of Beans, they will think you to differ nothing from themselves.</hi> So an old Man, speaking [to the People,] acting [in the State,] and honour'd, is a venerable Spectacle; but he, who wasts away his Days in his Bed, or sits discoursing of trivial Matters, and blowing his Nose in the Corner of a Gallery, easily renders himself an Object of Contempt. And this indeed <hi>Homer</hi> himself teaches those, who hear
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:46327:314"/>
[and understand him] aright. For <hi>Nestor,</hi> who fought before [the Walls of] <hi>Troy,</hi> was highly venerated and esteem'd; whilst <hi>Peleus</hi> and <hi>Laertes,</hi> who stay'd at Home, were slighted and despis'd. For the Habit of Prudence does not continue the same in those, who give themselves to their Ease; but by little and little dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes and is dissolv'd by Sloth, as always requiring some Exercise of the Thought, to rouse up and purifie the rational and active [Faculty of the Soul.] For
<q>Like glittring Brass, by being us'd it shines.</q> For the Infirmity of the Body does not so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the Administrations of those, who, almost spent with Age, go up to the Bench, or to the Council of War, as they are advantag'd by the Caution and Prudence, which [attend their Years, and] keeping them from thrusting themselves precipitately into Affairs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd partly by want of Experience, and partly by Vain-glory, and hurrying the People along with them by Violence, like a Sea, agitated by the Winds, cause them mildly and moderately to manage those, with whom they have to do.</p>
               <p>Whence Cities, when they are in Adversity and Fear, desire the Government of [grave and] ancient Personages; and often having drawn out of his Field [and Countrey-house] some old Man, who had not so much as the least thought of it, have compell'd him, though unwilling, to put his Hand to the Helm, and conduct [the Ship of] the State into [the Haven of] Security, rejecting such Generals and Orators, as [not only] knew how to speak loud, and make [long] Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues without drawing their Breath, [but were able] also valiantly to march forth, and fight their Enemies. So when the Orators, [one day] at <hi>Athens,</hi> uncovering before <hi>Timotheus</hi> and <hi>Iphicrates, Chares</hi> the Son of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chares,</hi>

               <p>What then? may some one say: do we not hear the Souldier in the Comedy affirming,

                  <hi>Aesops</hi> Fox indeed would not permit the Hedg-hog, who offer'd it, to take from him the Ticks, [that fed upon his Body:] <hi>For,</hi> said he, <hi>if thou remov'st those, that ara full, other hungry ones will succeed them:</hi> so 'tis of
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:46327:317"/> necessity, that a Common-wealth, which is always cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off those, who grow old, must be replenisht with young Men, thirsting after Glory and Power, and void of Understanding in State Affairs. For whence, [I pray, should they have it,] if they shall have been nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Disciples nor Spectators of any ancient Statesman? For if [Sea-Charts and] Treatises of Navigation cannot make those skilful Pilots, who have not often in the Stern been Spectators of the Conflicts against the Waves, Winds, and [pitchy Darkness of the] Night,
<q>
                     <l>When the poor trembling Sea-man longs to see</l>
                     <l>The safety boding Twins, <hi>Tyndaridae;</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q> How should a [raw] young Man take in hand [the Government of] a City, and rightly advise both the Senate and the People, having only read a Book, or written an Exercise in the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> concerning Policy, though he has seldom or never stood by the Reins or Helm, when grave Statesmen, and old Commanders, have in debating alledg'd both their Experiences and Fortunes, whilst he was wavering on both sides, that so he might with Dangers and transacting of Affairs, gain Instruction? This is not to be said. But if it were for nothing else, yet ought an old Man to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage in publick Affairs, that he may instruct and teach those, who are young. For as those, who teach [Children] Reading and Musick, do by pronouncing the [Letters, Syllables, and Words,] and singing Notes and Tunes before them, lead and bring on their Scholars: so an [old] Statesman, not by speaking, and dictating exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orly, but by acting and administring publick Affairs, directs [and breeds up] a young one, who is by his Deeds, joyn'd with his Words, interiorly form'd and fashion'd. For he, who is exercis'd after this manner,
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:46327:317"/> not amongst [the Disputes of] nimble Tongu'd Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as in the Wrestling-Schools, and Anointings where there is not [the least Appearance of] any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but really, and as it were in the <hi>Olympian</hi> and <hi>Pythian</hi> Games, [will tread in his Teachers Steps,]
<q>Like a young Colt, which runs by th' Horses side,</q> As <hi>Simonides</hi> has it. Thus <hi>Aristides</hi> [follow'd those of] <hi>Clisthenes, Cimon</hi> of <hi>Aristides, Phocion</hi> of <hi>Cabrias, Cato</hi> of <hi>Maximus Fabius, Pompey</hi> of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Polybius</hi> of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poemen:</hi> for these, when they were young, joyning themselves with their Elders, afterwards as it were flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and growing up by their Administrations and Actions, gain'd Experience and were inur'd to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of publick Affairs with Reputation and Power. <hi>Aeschines</hi> therefore the <hi>Academick,</hi> being charg'd by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sophisters, that he pretended himself a Disciple of <hi>Carneades,</hi> when he was not so, said: <hi>I was then an Hearer of</hi> Carneades, <hi>when his Discourse, having dismiss'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Noise, contracted it self to what was useful, and fit to be communicated.</hi> Now an aged Mans Government being not only in Words, but in Deeds, far remote from all Ostentation and Vain-glory: as they say of the Bird <hi>Ibis,</hi> that when she is grown old, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal'd all her venemous and stinking Savor, she sends forth a most sweet and aromatical one: so in Men, grown into Years, there is no Opinion or Counsel disturb'd, but all grave and setled. Wherefore, even for the young Mens Sake, as has been said, ought an old Man to act in the Government of the State: that, as <hi>Plato</hi> said of Wine, allay'd with Water, that the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God was made Wise, being chastis'd by another, who was sober: so the Caution of old Age, mixt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People with the Fervency of Youth, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:46327:318"/> by Glory and Ambition, may take off that, which is furious, and over-violent.</p>
               <p>But besides [all] this, they are under a Mistake, who think, that as Sailing, and going to the Wars, so also Acting in the State, is done for something else, and ceases, when that is obtain'd. For the Managing of State Affairs is not a Ministry, which has Profit for its End; but the Life of gentle, civil and sociable Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, fram'd by Nature to live civilly, honestly, and for the Benefit of Mankind. Wherefore 'tis fit, he should be such an one, as that it may be said of him, he is employ'd in State Affairs, and not he has been so employ'd; as also, that he is true, and not he has been true; he acts justly, and not he has acted justly; and that he loves his Country and Fellow Citizens, and not he has lov'd them. For to these things does Nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and these Voices does she sound to those, who are not totally corrupted with Sloth and Effeminacy:
<q>
                     <l>Thy Father has engendred thee a Man,</l>
                     <l>Worthy of much Esteem with Men—</l>
                  </q> And again,
<q>Let us not cease to benefit Mankind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now as for those, who pretend Weakness and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, they accuse rather Sickness, and Infirmity of Body, than old Age: for there are many young Men sickly [and weak,] and many old ones lusty [and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:] so that we are not to remove [from the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the State] aged, but impotent Persons; nor call [to it] such as are young, but such as are able [to bear the Burthen of it.] For <hi>Aridaeus</hi> was young, and <hi>Antigonus</hi> old, and yet the latter conquered in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all <hi>Asia,</hi> whereas the former, as if he had only
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:46327:318"/> been to make a dumb Shew with his Guards upon a Stage, was but the bare Name of a King, a Property, always mock'd by those, who were in Power. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would be a very Fool, that should think <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> the <hi>Sophister,</hi> and <hi>Philetas</hi> the Poet, Men indeed young, but withal weak, sickly, and most an end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd by their Infirmity to their Beds, fit to be concern'd in the Management of the State: so he [would be no less absurd,] that should hinder such [vigorous] old Men, as were <hi>Phocion, Masanissa</hi> the <hi>Libyan,</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> from governing, or leading forth of Armies. For <hi>Phocion,</hi> when the <hi>Athenians</hi> were at an unseasonable time hurrying to War, made Proclamation, that all, who were not above sixty years of Age, should take up Arms and follow him; and when they were offended at it, he said, <hi>There is no Hardship put upon you: for I, who am above fourscore years old, will be your General.</hi> And <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> relates, that <hi>Masanissa,</hi> dying at the Age of ninety years, left behind him a young Son of his own beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not above four years old; and that having a little before been in a great Fight, he was the next Day seen at the Door of his Tent eating a piece of brown Bread, and that, he said to those, who wondred at it, that he did this **
<q>
                     <l>For us'd, to shine, as polisht Brass, 'tis known;</l>
                     <l>But unemploy'd, in time with Rust's oregrown.</l>
                  </q> As <hi>Sophocles</hi> has it: we all say the same of that Light and Lustre of the Soul, by which we reason, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and think.</p>
               <p>Wherefore also they say, that Kings become better in Wars and military Expeditions, than when they live at ease. <hi>Attalus</hi> therefore, the Brother of <hi>Eumenes,</hi> being enervated with long Idleness and Peace, was with little Skill managed by <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> one of his Favorites,
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:46327:319"/> who fatned him [like an Hog in a Sty:] so that the <hi>Romans</hi> were wont in derision to ask those, who came out of <hi>Asia,</hi> whether the King had any Power with <hi>Philopoemen.</hi> Now one cannot find amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> many stouter Generals than <hi>Lucullus,</hi> as long as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd his Mind to Action; but when he gave himself up to an unactive Life, to a continuing lazily at Home, and an Unconcernedness for the Publick, being dull'd and mortify'd, like Spunges in calm Weather, and then delivering his old Age to be dieted and ordered by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listhenes</hi> one of his Free-men, he seem'd bewitch'd by him with Philters and other Incantations: till such time as his Brother <hi>Marcus,</hi> having driven away his Fellow, did himself govern and conduct the Remainder of his Life, which was not very long. But <hi>Darius,</hi> Father of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> [speaking of himself,] said, that by Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he grew wiser than himself. And the <hi>Scythian Ate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> affirmed, that he thought there was no Difference between himself and his Horse-keepers, when he was idle. And <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Elder, when one askt him, whether he was at leisure, answered, <hi>May that never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall me.</hi> For a Bow, they say, if over-bent, will break; and a Soul, if too much slackned. For even Musicians if they [over-long] omit to hear Accords; Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if they leave off demonstrating their Propositions; and Arithmeticians, if they discontinue their casting up of Accounts, do together with the Actions impair by the Progresses of Time the Habits, though they are not practical, but speculative Arts; but the Habit of States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being wise Counsel, Discretion, and Justice, and besides these, Experience, taking hold of Opportunities, and a Faculty [to make use] of Words, working Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, is maintain'd by frequent speaking, acting, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning and judging. And an hard thing it would be, that the avoiding to do these things should suffer such and so great Vertues to run out of the Soul. For 'tis
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:46327:319"/> probable also, that Humanity, friendly Society, and Beneficence will also decay, of which there ought to be no End or Limit.</p>

<q>And with strong hand restrains him, who would go.</q> And you indeed know, that I have these many <hi>Pythiads</hi> serv'd the <hi>Pythian [Apollo;]</hi> but yet you would not say to me: <hi>Thou hast sufficiently, O</hi> Plutarch, <hi>sacrificed, gone in Procession, and led Dances [in honour of the Gods:] 'tis now time, that being in years, thou shouldst in favour of thy old Age, lay aside the Garland, and leave the Oracle.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither do you think, that you, who are the chief Priest and Interpreter of Religious Ceremonies in the State, may leave the Service of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Protector of Cities, and Governor of Assemblies, for [the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of] which, you were long since consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>But leaving, if you please, this Discourse [about things] withdrawing [old Men] from [performing their Duties to] the State; let us make it a little the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Consideration and Philosophy, how we may
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:46327:320"/> enjoyn them no Exercise, unfitting, or grievous to their Years, the Adminstration of a Common-wealth having many Parts, beseeming and suitable for such Persons. For, as if we were oblig'd to finish [our Days with persevering in the Practice of] singing, it would behove us, being now grown old, of the many Tunes and Tensions, there are of the Voice, which the Musicians call Harmonies, not to aim at the highest and shrilest [Note,] but [to make choice of that] in which there is an Easiness, [joyn'd] with a decent Suitableness: so since 'tis more natural for Men to act and speak even to the end of their Lives, than 'tis for Swans to sing, we must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Action, like an Harp, that is set too high, but [rather] let it a little down, accommodating it to such Employs in the State, as are easie, moderate, and fitting for Men in years. For neither do we suffer our Bodies to be altogether motionless, and unexercis'd, because we cannot [any longer] make use of Spades and Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, nor yet throw Coits, or skirmish in Armor, as we have formerly Done; but some of us do by Swing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Walking, others by playing gently at Ball, and some again by Discoursing, stir up our Spirits, and revive our [natural] Heat. Therefore neither let us permit our selves to be wholly chill'd and frozen by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleness; nor yet on the contrary, let us by burthening our selves with every Office, or intermedling with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry publick business, force our old Age, convinc'd of its Disability, to break forth into these Exclamations,
<q>
                     <l>The Spear to brandish, thou, Right Hand, art bent;</l>
                     <l>But weak old Age opposes thy Intent.</l>
                  </q> Since even that Man is not commended, who in the Vigor and Strength of his Years, imposing all publick Affairs in general on himself, and unwilling to leave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for another, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> say of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> thrusts
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:46327:320"/> himself into all Employs, and intermeddles in every Business, through an insatiable Desire of Glory, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy against those, who are in some measure Partakers of Honour and Authority in the State. But to an old Man, though you should free him from the Infamy, yet painful and miserable would be an Ambition, always laying wait at every Election of Magistrates, a Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, attending for every Opportunity of Judicature, or Assembling in Counsel, and an Humor of Vain-glory, catching at every Ambassie and Patronage. For the doing of these things, even with the Favour [and good Liking of every one] is too heavy for that Age; and yet the contrary to this happens: for they are hated by the young Men, as leaving them no Occasions of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor suffering them to put themselves forth: and their ambitious Desire of Primacy and Rule is no less odious to others, than the Covetousness and Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of other old Men. Therefore, as <hi>Alexander,</hi> unwilling to tire his <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> when he now began to grow old, did before the Fight ride on other Horses, to view his Army, and draw it up for Battel: and then, after the Signal was given, mounting this, marcht forth, and charg'd the Enemy: so a Statesman, if he is wise, moderating himself, when he finds Years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, will abstain from [intermedling in] unnecessary Affairs, and suffering the State to make use of younger Persons in smaller Matters, will readily exercise himself in [such, as are of] great [importance.] For Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, [or such as play publick Prizes,] indeed keep their Bodies untouch'd and unimploy'd in necessary Matters, [that they may be in a readiness] for unprofitable [and superfluous Engagements;] but let us on the contrary, letting pass little and frivolous, carefully preserve our selves for worthy [and gallant Actions.] For all things perhaps, as <hi>Homer</hi> says, equally become a young Man; [now all Men] esteem and love him: so that for [under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:46327:321"/> frequently] little and many Businesses, they say, he is laborious and a good Commonwealths-man, and for [enterprizing none but] splendid and noble Actions, they stile him generous and magnanimous; nay, there are also some Occurrences, when even Contention and Rashness have a certain Seasonableness and Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming such Men. But an old Mans Undertaking in a State such servile Employs, as are the farming out of the Customs, and the looking after the Havens and Market-place, or else his running on Embassies and Journeys to Princes and Potentates, when there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary or honorable Affair to be treated of, but only Complements, and a maintaining of Correspondence, such an one, dear Friend, seems to me a thing misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not to be imitated; but to others, perhaps o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and intolerable.</p>
               <p>For 'tis not even seasonable for such Men to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in Magistracies, unless it be such, as bear some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Grandeur and Dignity; such is the Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Councel of <hi>Areopagus,</hi> which you now exercise, and such also by <hi>Jove</hi> is the Excellency of the <hi>Amphictro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Office, which your Countrey has conferr'd on you for your Life, having an easie Labour, and pleasant Pains. And yet old Men ought not ambitiously to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect even these Honours, but to accept them with Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, not seeking, but being sought; nor as taking Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on themselves, but bestowing themselves on Government. For 'tis not, as <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> said, a Shame for those that are above threescore years old, to reach forth their Hands to the Physician; but it far more mis-beseems them to hold up their Hands to the People, to beg their Votes or Suffrages for the obtaining Offices; for this is ungenerous and mean; whereas the contrary has a certain Majesty and Comeliness, when, his Countrey choosing, inviting, and expecting him, he comes down with Honour and Courtesie to welcome and
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:46327:321"/> receive the Present, truly befitting his old Age and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. After the same manner also ought he, that is grown old, to use his Speech in Assemblies, not ever and anon climbing up to the Desk [to make Harangues,] nor always like a Cock, crowing against those that speak, nor letting the Reins of the young Mens Respect to him, by contending against them, and provoking them, nor breeding in them a Desire and Custom of Disobedience, and Unwillingness to hear him; but to pass by, and let them strut and brave it against his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; neither being present, nor concerning himself much at it, as long as there is no great Danger to the Publick Safety, nor any Offence against what is honest and decent.</p>
               <p>But in such Cases [on the contrary] he ought, though no Body call him, to run beyond his Strength, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver himself to be led, or carry'd in a Chair, as Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians report of <hi>Claudius Appius</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> For he, having understood, that the Senate [after their Army had been] in a great Fight worsted by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> were [debating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout] receiving Proposals of Peace and Alliance, could not bear it, but, although he had lost both his Eyes, caus'd himself to be carry'd through the common Place strait to the Senate-house, where entring amongst them, and standing up in the midst, he said, That he had formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been troubled at his being depriv'd of his Sight, but that he now wisht he had also lost his Ears, rather than to have heard, that the [<hi>Roman</hi> Senators] were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting and acting things so ungenerous and dishonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And then partly reprehending, and partly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exciting them, he perswaded them to betake themselves presently to their Arms, and fight with <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> for [the Dominion of] <hi>Italy.</hi> And <hi>Solon,</hi> when the Popularity of <hi>Pisistratus</hi> was discover'd to be [only] a Plot [for the obtaining] of a Tyranny [over them,] none daring to oppose or impeach it, did himself bring
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:46327:322"/> forth his Arms, and setting them before [the Doors of] his House, call'd out to the People to assist him; and when <hi>Pisistratus</hi> sent to ask him, what gave him the Confidence to act in that manner: <hi>My old Age,</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he.</p>
               <p>For Matters, that are so necessary as these, inflame and rouse up old Men, who are in a manner extinct; so that they have but any Breath yet left them; but in other Occurrences [an old Man,] as has been said, shall be careful to avoid mean and servile Offices, and such, in which the Trouble to those, who manage them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Advantage and Profit, for which they are done. Sometimes by expecting also, till the Citizens call, and desire, and fetch him out of House, he is thought more worthy of Credit [and Authority,] by those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest him. And even when he is present, let him for the most part silently permit the younger Men to speak, as if he were an Arbitrator, judging, to whom the Reward and Honor of this their Debate about publick Matters ought to be given; but if any thing should exceed a due Mediocrity, let him mildly reprehend it, and with Sweetness cut off all obstinate Contentions, all injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and cholerick Expressions, directing and teaching (without reproof) him, that errs in his Opinions, boldly praising him, that is in the Right, and often willing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

But he, who instructs a young Man in publick Affairs and Negotiations of the State, and prepares him
<q>Both to speak well, and act heroickly</q> For [the Service of] his Country, is in no small or mean Degree useful to the Common-wealth; but in that, at which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> chiefly and principally aiming himself, accustom'd young Men to persist in Obedience to every one, that was elder, as if he were a Law-giver: For to what, [think you,] had <hi>Lysander</hi> respect, when he said, that in <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> Men most honorably grew old? Was it, because old Men might there chiefly look after the Tilling of their Ground, put out Money to Use, sit together at Tables, and after their Game <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>y such thing. But because all such Men, being after some sort in the Place of Magistrates, fatherly Governors, or Tutors of Youth, inspected not only the Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but also made inquiry, [and that] not slightly into every Action of the younger Men, both as concerning their Exercises, Recreations, and Diet, being terrible indeed to Offenders, but venerable and desirable to the Good. For young Men indeed always venerate and follow those, who increase and cherish the Nearness and Generosity of their Disposition without any Envy,
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:46327:323"/> For this Vice, though beseeming no Age, is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in young Men vail'd with specious Names, being stil'd Emulation, Zeal, and Desire of Honour; but in old Men 'tis altogether unseasonable, savage, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly. Therefore a Statesman, that is in years, must be very far from being Envious, and not like those old Trees and Stocks, which, as with a certain Charm, manifestly withdraw the nutritive Juice from such young Plants, as grow near them, or spring up under them, and hinder their Growth; but kindly to admit, and even offer himself to those, that apply themselves to him, and seek to converse with him, directing, leading, and educating them, not only by good Instructions and Counsels, but also by affording them the Means of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring such publick Affairs, as may bring them Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Repute, and executing such unprejudicial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, as will be pleasing and acceptable to the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. But for such things, as, being untoward and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, do, like Medicines, at first gripe and molest, but afterwards yield Honor and Profit; upon these things he ought not to put young Men, nor expose those, who are unexperienc'd, to the Mutinous Clamors of the rude and ill-natur'd Multitude, but should rather take the <hi>Odium</hi> upon himself for such things, as [though harsh and unpleasing] may yet prove beneficial to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; for this will render the young Men both more affectionate to him, and more chearful in [the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking] other Services.</p>
               <p>But besides all this, [that we have already said,] we are [to consider and] keep in mind, that to be a States-man, is not only to bear Offices, go on Embassies, talk aloud in publick Meetings, and thunder on the Bench, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing such things, in which the Vulgar think the Art of Government to consist: as they also do, that those only philosophize, who dispute from a Chair, and spend their Leisure-time in Books. But the Policy
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:46327:324"/> and Philosophy, continually exercis'd in Works, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous in Actions, was no wise unknown to them: for they say, as <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> affirm'd, that they, who fetch Turns to and fro in Galleries, walk; but not they, who go into the Country, or to [visit] a Friend. But the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Statesman is like the being a Philosopher. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Socrates</hi> did not only philosophize, when he neither plac'd Benches, nor seated himself in his Chair, nor kept the Hour of Conference and Walking, appointed for his Disciples, but also when, as it hapned, he play'd, drank, went to War with some, bargain'd, finally, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when he was imprison'd, and drank the Poyson: having first shewn, that [Mans] Life does at all times, in every part, and universally in all Passions and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, admit of Philosophy. The same also we are to understand of Civil Government, [to wit,] that Fools do not administer the State, either when they lead forth Armies, write Dispatches [and Edicts,] or make Speeches to the People, but that they either [endeavor to insinuate themselves into the Favour of the Vulgar, and] become popular, seek applause by their Harangues, raise Seditions and Disturbances, or [at the best] perform some Service, as compell'd by necessity. But he, that seek the publick Good, loves his Country and Fellow Citizens, has a serious regard [to the Welfare of the State,] and is a true Common wealths-man, such an one,] though he never puts on [the military Garment, or Senatorial] Robe, is yet always imploy'd in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the State, by inciting [to Action] those, who are able, guiding [and instructing] those, that want it, assisting [and advising] those, that ask Counsell, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning [and reclaiming] those, that are ill given, [and about to do mischief] and confirming [and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] those, that are well minded: so that 'tis manifest, he does not for fashions sake apply himself to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, nor go [then] to the Theatre or Councel,
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:46327:324"/> when there is any hast, or he is sent for [by Name,] that he may have the first Place there, being otherwise [only] present for his Recreation, as when he goes to [see] some Shew, or to hear [a Consort of Musick;] but [on the contrary,] though absent in Body, yet is he present in Mind, and being inform'd of what is done, approves some things, and disapproves others. For neither did <hi>Aristides</hi> amongst the <hi>Athenians,</hi> nor <hi>Cato</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Romans</hi> often execute the Office of Chief Magistrate, and yet [both the one and the other] em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd their whole Lives perpetually in the Service of their Country. And <hi>Epaminondas</hi> indeed, being Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, perform'd many and great Actions; but yet there is related an Exploit of his, when he had neither Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Army, nor Office in the State, not inferior to any of them: [perform'd] about <hi>Thessaly:</hi> for, when the Commanders, having [through Inadvertency] drawn a Squadron into a difficult and disadvantageous Ground, were in a maze, for that the Enemies press'd hard upon them, galling them with their Arrows; he, being call'd up from amongst the heavy-arm'd Foot, first by his encouraging them dissipated the Trouble and Fright of the Army, and then having arrang'd and brought into Order that Squadron, whose Ranks had been broken, he easily disengag'd them [out of those Straits,] and plac'd them in front against their Enemies, who, thereupon changing [their Resolutions,] marcht off. Also when <hi>Agis,</hi> King [of <hi>Sparta,</hi>] was leading on his Army, already put in good Order for Fight, against the Enemies, a certain old <hi>Spartan</hi> call'd out aloud to him, that he thought to cure one Evil by another; shewing, that he was desirous, the present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable Promptness to fight should salve the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of their over-hasty Departure from before <hi>Argos,</hi> as <hi>Thucydides</hi> says. Now <hi>Agis,</hi> hearing him, took his Advice, and at that present retreated; but [afterwards]
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:46327:325"/> got the Victory. And there was every day set a Chair [for him] before the Doors of the Palace, and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori,</hi> often rising [from their Consistory, and going] to him, ask'd [his Advice,] and consulted him about the greatest [and most important Affairs:] for he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd very prudent, and is recorded to have been a Man of great Sense. And therefore having now wholly exhausted the Strength of his Body, and being for the most part ty'd to his Bed, when the <hi>Ephori</hi> sent for him to the common Hall of the City, he strave to get up, and go to them; but walking heavily, and with great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and meeting by the way certain Boys, he askt them, whether they knew any thing stronger than the Necessity of obeying their Master. And they answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, [that] Inability [was of greater Force,] he supposing, that this ought to be the Limit of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, turn'd back again homewards. For a Readiness [and Good Will to serve the Publick,] ought not to fail, whilst Ability lasts; but when that is once gone, 'tis no longer to be forc'd. And indeed <hi>Scipio,</hi> both in War and Peace, always us'd <hi>Caius Laelius</hi> for a Councellor: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that some said, <hi>Scipio</hi> was the Actor of those no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Exploits, and <hi>Caius</hi> the Poet, [or Author.] And <hi>Cicero</hi> himself confess'd, that the honorablest and greatest of his Councels, by the right performance of which he [in his Consulship] preserv'd his Country, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed with <hi>Publius Nigidius</hi> the Philosopher. Thus is there nothing, that in many manners of Government hinders old Men from helping the Publick by the best things, [to wit, by their] Reason, Sentences, Freedom of Speech, and sollicitous Care, as the Poets term it. For not only our Hands, Feet, and corporal Strength are the Possession and Share of the Common-weal; but chiefly our Soul, and the Beauties of our Soul, Justice, Temperance, and Prudence, which receiving their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection late and slowly, 'twere absurd, that Men should
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:46327:325"/>
[come to] enjoy House and Land, and other Wealth, and yet should not be beneficial to their common Country and Fellow Citizens, by [continuance of] Time, which does not so much detract from their Ministerial Abilities, as it adds to their Directive and Political. And this is the reason, why they pourtray'd the elder <hi>Mercuries</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hands and Feet, but having their natural Parts stiff, enigmatically representing, that there is no great need of old Mens corporal Services, if they have but their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as is convenient, active and fruitful.</p>
